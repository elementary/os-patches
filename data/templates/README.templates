Channel Definition
------------------

The .info files allow to specify a set of default channels that is available
in the dialog "add channel". The .info file whose name corresponds to the
LSB release name is used, e.g. 'Ubuntu.info' on a Ubuntu system.

Furthermore all .info files are used to render the channels presented in the
sources list more user friendly.

Abstract paragraphs
-------------------
If the Suite name contains a {, the entire paragraph becomes a template
that gets formatted with distro-info-data data. See the Ubuntu.info.in
and Debian.info.in for examples.

Note that in such a case, if these paragraphs use { in their values for
non-template things, such as in regular expressions; they need to be
escaped - { to {{ and } to }}.

Abstract paragraphs can only be in the middle of the file, the head and the
tail are copied unmodified. If abstract paragraphs are interleaved with
concrete ones, the behavior is undefined.
