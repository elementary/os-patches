# Application configuration options
#
# NOTE: Having an entry here for an application with allowed=true means that
#       geoclue will not ask agent to authorize the application. This is to
#       ensure that system components and applications with built-in
#       authorization mechanism (e.g web browsers) do not have to be bound to
#       agents.
