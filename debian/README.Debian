distro-info
===========

The distro-info package provides centralized lists of code-names and release
history for the supported distributions (Currently: Debian and Ubuntu).
The distro-info data (in the distro-info-data package) can be updated once,
and all the packages using it will have the latest data. This avoids having to
hard-code current development release names (and other such volatile data)
into packages.

Outdated Data Errors
====================

If you get an error that the package data is out of date, look for a newer
distro-info-data package in your distribution's updates.

On Debian, this is:
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stable-updates main

On Ubuntu, it is:
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $RELEASE-updates main
where $RELEASE is the name of your release.

If there isn't an update available yet, you should be able to install the
latest version from Debian/unstable.

Or pull it from the Internet at:

* https://debian.pages.debian.net/distro-info-data/debian.csv
* https://debian.pages.debian.net/distro-info-data/ubuntu.csv
