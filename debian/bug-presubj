MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING THE LATEST VERSION

The grub packages never update the installed version of GRUB
automatically, except if you choose a device in the debconf prompt
`GRUB install devices', which is currently only implemented for grub-pc.

Because of this, you need to make sure you're running the LATEST VERSION of
GRUB before you report a bug.  Use grub-install to update it, and then check
if the bug still applies.  Debugging problems we already fixed makes us waste
valuable time, so please try to avoid it.

IMPORTANT NOTE WHEN SUBMITTING PATCHES

Like many other FSF projects, GRUB upstream has specific requirements for
accepting patches with regard to copyright assignment.  If you're going to
submit a patch, it is likely that it will only be accepted in upstream if you're
willing to submit your paperwork as well.

Because of this, we want to avoid diverging from upstream by adding patches to
the Debian package unless we know the copyright issues can be sorted out.  We
encourage you to submit your work to upstream directly by sending a mail to the
GRUB maintainers <grub-devel@gnu.org>.
