Flatpak in Debian
=================

Flathub
-------

Flathub is a reference app-store for Flatpak apps. It is not enabled by
default in Debian, in order to keep the Debian distribution self-contained
and entirely Free Software. See https://flatpak.org/setup/Debian/ for
more information on how to add Flathub as a source of apps and runtimes.

Note that Flathub includes both Free Software and non-Free apps.

Adding Flatpak apps to search paths
-----------------------------------

This is mostly done automatically on systems that implement
environment.d(5), and in particular systems that use systemd. It is also
done automatically on systems that source /etc/profile.d.

On systems that do not implement environment.d(5) or source
/etc/profile.d, you will need to amend the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment
variable so that desktop environments will find Flatpak apps. Add the
following paths:

- $XDG_DATA_HOME/flatpak/exports/share, for Flatpak apps installed in the
  user's home directory (the default for $XDG_DATA_HOME is ~/.local/share)

- /var/lib/flatpak/export/share, for Flatpak apps installed system-wide

- The exports/share subdirectory of any extra installations configured in
  /etc/flatpak/installations.d/ (see flatpak-installation(5) for details)

If XDG_DATA_HOME is set to a non-default value, you might need to add
$XDG_DATA_HOME/flatpak/exports/share to the search path yourself, or be
careful with the order in which environment variables are set. Using the
default is encouraged.

On systems using GNOME's gdm display manager (the gdm3 Debian
package), adding /usr/share/doc/flatpak/examples/etc/gdm3/flatpak.env
to /etc/gdm3/env.d/ might be helpful. However, if you use other app
frameworks that also need to amend the search path (such as Canonical's
Snap), due to limitations in gdm's env.d mechanism, it will be necessary
to construct a single search path that combines the search paths for
Flatpak and the other app framework(s). environment.d(5) does not have
these limitations, and is recommended.
