flatpak (1.3.4-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  This version of flatpak has an incompatible change to the way default
  remotes can be configured in /etc/flatpak/remotes.d.

  Previous versions would read *.conf files from that directory and
  treat them as preconfigured remotes for the system-wide installation
  in /var/lib/flatpak, which could not be reconfigured or removed in the
  usual way through UIs like flatpak(1).

  From this version, default remotes are instead configured by
  placing an ordinary .flatpakrepo file (see flatpak-flatpakrepo(5))
  in /etc/flatpak/remotes.d. These are automatically imported into the
  system-wide installation as if via flatpak-remote-add(1) the first time
  flatpak is run.

  flatpak remembers which remotes were already added in this way,
  so sysadmins can delete them in the usual way, for instance using
  flatpak-remote-delete(1), and they will not be re-added. They can also
  be reconfigured with flatpak-remote-modify(1) as usual.
