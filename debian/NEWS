grub2 (1.96+20090609-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Before this version, grub-efi was 32bit on i386 and 64bit on amd64.
  However, EFI can be 32bit even if you have a 64bit CPU, like in the
  first MacBook models with Core 2 Duo released in late 2006.  Thus,
  grub-efi has been split into grub-efi-amd64 and grub-efi-ia32 which are
  available on both amd64 and i386.
  
  If you've experienced problems trying to load grub.efi, please try
  again using the package that doesn't match your CPU's architecture.
