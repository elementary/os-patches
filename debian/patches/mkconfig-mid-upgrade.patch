Subject: Bail out if trying to run grub-mkconfig during upgrade to 2.00

Since files in /etc/grub.d/ are conffiles, they are not put in place
until grub-common is configured, meaning that they may be out of sync
with the parts of grub-mkconfig that reside in /usr/.  In GRUB 1.99,
/etc/grub.d/00_header contained a reference to ${GRUB_PREFIX}/video.lst.
This and other code from 1.99 breaks with 2.00's grub-mkconfig.
Deferring this to when grub-PLATFORM.postinst eventually runs is safe
and avoids this problem.
