Subject: kern/file: Ensure file->data is set

This is to avoid a generic issue were some filesystems would not set
data and also not set a grub_errno. This meant it was possible for many
filesystems to grub_dl_unref() themselves multiple times resulting in
it being possible to unload the filesystems while there were still
references to them, e.g., via a loopback.
