Subject: kern/dl: Check for the SHF_INFO_LINK flag in
 grub_dl_relocate_symbols()

The grub_dl_relocate_symbols() iterates through the sections in
an ELF looking for relocation sections. According to the spec [1]
the SHF_INFO_LINK flag should be set if the sh_info field is meant
to be a section index.
