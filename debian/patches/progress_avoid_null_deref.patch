Subject: progress: avoid NULL dereference for net files

From original patch by dann frazier <dann.frazier@canonical.com>:

  grub_net_fs_open() saves off a copy of the file structure it gets passed and
  uses it to create a bufio structure. It then overwrites the passed in file
  structure with this new bufio structure. Since file->name doesn't get set
  until we return back to grub_file_open(), it means that only the bufio
  structure gets a valid file->name. The "real" file's name is left
  uninitialized. This leads to a crash when the progress module hook is called
  on it.

grub_net_fs_open() already saved copy of file name as ->net->name, so change
progress module to use it.

Also, grub_file_open may leave file->name as NULL if grub_strdup fails. Check
for it.
