Subject: Disable gfxpayload=keep by default

Setting gfxpayload=keep has been known to cause efifb to be
inappropriately enabled.  In any case, with the current Linux kernel the
result of this option is that early kernelspace will be unable to print
anything to the console, so (for example) if boot fails and you end up
dumped to an initramfs prompt, you won't be able to see anything on the
screen.  As such it shouldn't be enabled by default in Debian, no matter
what kernel options are enabled.

gfxpayload=keep is a good idea but rather ahead of its time ...
