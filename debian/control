Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS modules)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .
 This package contains GRUB modules that have been built for use with the
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.  It can be installed in parallel with
 other flavours, but will not automatically install GRUB as the active boot
 loader nor automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade unless grub-pc is also

Multi-Arch: foreign
Description: GRUB firmware image for QEMU
 This package contains a binary of GRUB that has been built for use as
 firmware for QEMU.  It can be used as a replacement for other PC BIOS
 images provided by seabios, bochsbios, and so on.
 .
 In order to make QEMU use this firmware, simply add `-bios grub.bin' when
 invoking it.
 .
 This package behaves in the same way as GRUB for coreboot, but doesn't
 contain any code from coreboot itself, and is only suitable for QEMU. If
 you want to install GRUB as firmware on real hardware, you need to use the
 grub-coreboot package, and manually combine that with coreboot.
