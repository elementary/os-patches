plymouth for Debian
-------------------

Plymouth supports both KMS (kernel mode setting) and standard console output.
For standard console support the plymouth-x11 package has to be installed.

The following steps are required in order to enable the plymouth bootsplash:

  * In case the KMS backend should be used and KMS is not yet enabled on your
    system, add the following lines to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules:

    # for KMS with Intel graphic cards
    i915 modeset=1

    # for KMS with NVIDIA graphic cards
    nouveau modeset=1

    # for KMS with AMD (ATI) graphic cards
    radeon modeset=1

    Remember to afterwards rebuild the initrd with 'update-initramfs -u' as
    root.

  * Install plymouth and optionally the plymouth-themes packages.

  * Add 'splash' as boot parameter in your bootloader configuration.

  * Optionally switch to a different theme by running
    update-alternative --config default.plymouth (and rebuilding the initrd again).
