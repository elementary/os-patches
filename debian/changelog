    - rework the motd-news, using a systemd timer, LP: #1637800 comment #4
    - timer fires the first time, 1 minute after boot, and then every 12 hours

  * Change /usr/share/base-files/dot.profile (the default /root/.profile)

  * Add extra code in postinst so that people who never modified
    their /root/.profile from jessie get the fixed version. This is
    done by the update_to_current_default() function, which is now
    more general and allows updating files not in /etc.
  * While we are at it, modify install_from_default() function so that
    it's called in the same simplified way as update_to_current_default().

base-files (8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release for jessie as stable:
  - Use "8" as version in /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net. As usual, this
    is never expected to change once that jessie is released as Debian 8.
  - Use 8.0 as version in /etc/debian_version. As usual, this is expected
    to change at every point release.
  - Changed PRETTY_NAME in /usr/lib/os-release, adding 8 as version number
    and "(jessie)" as codename. Added also VERSION_ID and VERSION.
    This file, /usr/lib/os-release, is not expected to change either.
  - Updated README (jessie -> stretch).
  * Packages are not expected to rely on the contents of any of these
    files, but if they do, they might better break now while we can still
    fix them.

base-files (7.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dropped "chown root:root" lines in postinst, as they are
    completely redundant. The postinst script is run by root.

base-files (7.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * The change introduced in version 7.7 regarding /mnt seems to break
    the ability of debootstrap currently in wheezy to create a sid chroot.
    The case of initial install of /mnt is already handled by postinst line
    "install_directory mnt 755 root" inside the big "if" block that
    creates a bunch of other things, so we can restrict re-creating the /mnt
    directory on upgrades to the case when we are really upgrading.
    Therefore, the code is moved to the same "if" block where /etc/profile
    and /etc/nsswitch.conf are upgraded to their new defaults when unchanged.
    This might help as a workaround for Bug#766459.

base-files (7.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The /etc/profile.d mechanism may be used to override PS1 setting
    in /etc/bash.bashrc, which is particularly nice because there is
    no need to modify /etc/profile or /etc/bash.bashrc for that,
    but this is no longer possible if /etc/profile.d is sourced
    before /etc/bash.bashrc. Therefore, /etc/profile.d is sourced
    after /etc/bash.bashrc again. Closes: #766351.

base-files (7.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated FAQ to explain that only /etc/debian_version is updated at
    every point release, using Debian 8.x as an example, to be read by
    users of jessie during its lifetime as stable. Closes: #621757.
  * Changed default /etc/profile to source /etc/bash.bashrc after
    processing profile.d stuff, not before. Closes: #698479.
  * Drop comment lines about umask in /etc/profile, as it has been
    there for enough time for everybody to take note.
  * The directory /mnt is not included inside base-files.deb anymore.
    Instead, it is created by postinst the very first time base-files
    is installed (by debootstrap), or when upgrading from an earlier
    base-files version. This should make the usual upgrade at every point
    release to work even if /mnt is a stale mount point. Closes: #763405.

  * By default, when the computer is booting, green and red colors are used
    to signal that a service started successfully, or that it did not.
    In this context, trying to use colors for something else might be
    misleading or even confusing. For this reason, I'm dropping
    ANSI_COLOR from /usr/lib/os-release. Closes: #758246.

base-files (6.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Record md5sums of unmodified /etc/profile versions so that we can
    upgrade it automatically, as it's done in Ubuntu.
  * In the initial install, create /etc/motd.tail instead of /etc/motd,
    as /etc/motd is converted to a symlink by initscripts and /etc/motd.tail
    is since a long time the master copy to which the output of uname is added.
    Remove postinst code which tries to update /etc/motd, as it does no longer
    work and the file has not changed in a lot of time. Will add code to
    update /etc/motd.tail based on md5sum if it ever changes in a future.
  * Implement proposed transition plan for group staff in /usr/local.
    The file /etc/staff-group-for-usr-local is now created on upgrades
    from releases before 6.10 and (for now) also on initial install.
  * Removed reference to /etc/nsswitch.conf in extended description, as
    the file is being moved to libc-bin.

  * Added /etc/os-release. Closes: #659853. Note: for stable releases
    this file will look like it's suggested in the bug report above.
    Also, like /etc/debian_version, this file should only be considered
    meaningful for stable releases, which testing and unstable are not.
  * By popular demand, make /etc/profile a conffile. Closes: #668871.
  * Added /sys for all systems but the Hurd. Closes: #670091.

  * Merge from Debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - Branding changes.
    - Add /etc/lsb-release file.
    - Add lsb-release-udeb package.
    - Record md5sums of unmodified /etc/profile versions so that we can
      upgrade it automatically.
    - Various bashrc extensions.
    - Do not install /usr/local dirs with staff group writeability, as there

    - Restore order line in /etc/host.conf with a comment.
    - Ship /root mode 700 by default.
  * Dropped changes:
    - drop versioned dependency on libpam-modules, satisfied in all versions
      since hardy (and earlier)
    - remove /var/lock and /var/run: this is handled differently in Debian,
      no reason to diverge
    - fixing up permissions of files copied by ubiquity: transition completed
      in lucid.
    - debian/postinst.in: replace references to /var/run with /run: /run is
      still a draft standard for the time being and should only be used for
      those parts of the system that were being placed *other* than in
      /var/run for various reasons (e.g., /dev/.udev, /lib/init/rw).
      /var/run must continue to exist and be functional, and initscripts
      guarantees a smooth transition from /var/run to /run once we are ready
      to start doing away with /var/run (once the FHS officially ratifies
      /run as its replacement), so there's no reason to diverge from Debian
      here.

    It is definitely not base-files business to change the permissions of

base-files (5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed umask in default /etc/profile to 002, which has a little bit
    more sense than 022 on systems like Debian having User Private Groups.
    As usual for /etc/profile, only new installs will have the new default,
    so nobody will be surprised by this on upgrades. Hopefully, this change
    will be documented in the release notes for squeeze as well, for users
    who install squeeze from scratch. Closes: #248140, #581434.

    The old permissions were of little benefit, and the user can still
    change this after installing a new system anyway.
  * Renamed FAQ to README and added a compatibility symlink.
  * Removed obsolete Depends on base-passwd, as version 2.0.3.4 is more
    than 10 years old and we don't support upgrades which skip releases.
  * Dropped preinst completely, as it was there just to support upgrades
    from very old releases (that we don't support anymore).

    with permissions set by logrotate. Closes: #547407.
  * Do not export PS1 in /root/.bashrc, as it has bash escapes and it's

  * Added debian_chroot variable to default PS1 in /root/.bashrc.
  * Comment out PS1 in /root/.bashrc anyway, as /etc/profile and
    /etc/bash.bashrc already care about it. Closes: #443245.
  * Comment out umask as well, as it's already in /etc/profile.
  * Added /usr/local/games to default PATH in /etc/profile. Closes: #487105.
  * While we are at it, comment out everything about PATH, as /etc/login.defs
    should already care about this.
  * Changed default /etc/profile so that it sources /etc/bash.bashrc
    if the shell is bash. Closes: #275622.
  * Drop \u part from default PS1 in /etc/profile, as it's only useful
    for people with several non-root accounts. Most people are either root
    or an ordinary user, so $ and # are enough to differentiate between them.
  * Comment out PS1 setting in /etc/profile anyway, as we have bash.bashrc.

  Fix double-printing of motd.tail, LP: #550561
  * debian/postinst.in: motd.tail should no longer be generated by this
    package; rather it's where the sysadmin would add static text to
    append to the dynamically generated /etc/motd
  * debian/update-motd.d/*, debian/rules:
    - move update-motd scripts to this dir, clean up install rules
      (scripts were getting installed in two places)
    - 00-header: add the lsb_release information, which seems at least
      as pertinent as the kernel's version and build-date
    - 00-header, 99-footer: split the header (uname, lsb_release) and
      the footer (admin's motd.tail) to two separate scripts

  * Changed awk from Depends to Pre-Depends. Closes: #314571, #469552.
    This is required to make the awk virtual package to be truly essential,
    as only essential packages, their predependencies, and the dependencies
    of their predependencies are guaranteed to be "working at all times".
    Previously, the packaging system was allowed to remove an awk flavour
    and install another one in the middle of an upgrade, which may break
    packages using awk in their preinsts (and in fact, it happened).
    Tkanks a lot to Steve Langasek for clarifying this issue.

base-files (4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed issue, issue.net and debian_version to read "4.0".
  * Changed PATHs in default /etc/profile to not contain /usr/bin/X11,
    as this is no longer needed by the X packages in etch (Closes: #388586).

base-files (3.1.16ubuntu2) feisty; urgency=low

    'link-local 169.254.0.0'. (See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZeroConfNetworking

  * /etc/issue, /etc/issue.net, /etc/lsb-release: Welcome to Feisty!
  * /etc/host.conf: Restore order line with a comment that it is not used by

    (see Debian bug #354115).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 27 Oct 2006 11:04:47 +0100

base-files (3.1.16) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (3.1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/local/etc, required by FHS (Closes: #383493).
    [ As usual, please note that this will only affect new installs ].
    This directory is also allowed to be a symlink to /etc/local, but that's
    a decision to be made by the end user after installing the system.

base-files (3.1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

base-files (3.1.9ubuntu9) edgy; urgency=low

  * And due to the changes in the last upload, we need to depend on a
    libc6 new enough that we get /lib64 created BEFORE we remove our

  * debian/control: Add dependency libpam-modules (>= 0.79-3ubuntu3) so that
    the user does not end up without any $PATH at all.
  * Add share/profile.md5sums: Record the md5sums of unmodified /etc/profile
    of warty, hoary, breezy, current dapper, and this new version for dapper.
  * debian/postinst: If /etc/profile matches one of the recorded md5sums,
    replace it with the current version on upgrades.
  * debian/rules, clean rule: Automatically update share/profile.md5sums with
    the current md5sum of share/profile.

base-files (3.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added mdns to hosts line in default /etc/nsswitch.conf to support
    mDNS when available (Closes: #324954). Suggested by Joey Hess.
  * Dropped %h from issue.net, as it's not supported by all telnetd
    daemons and it's not even supported by ssh (Closes: #329682).

base-files (3.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed issue, issue.net and debian_release to "testing/unstable".
    Not that this is a lot useful, but at least is what people expect.
  * Made /home to be 755 and root:root by default, since nobody finds
    the sgid bit in such directory useful for anything.

base-files (3.1.0ubuntu2) hoary; urgency=low

  * debian/postinst: Do not install /usr/local and subdirectories with "staff"
    group writeability. This group is essentially root-equivalent, but there
    are cases where somebody can become any user but root (like NFS).
  * debian/rules: Do not install /home as root:staff, it makes no sense.
  * debian/2775-dirs: Remove "home".
  * Ubuntu bug #7449

    Removed libreadline incarnations from Replaces field accordingly.
    This file will probably be managed by libreadline-common some day.

base-files (3.0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * FAQ: Documented the fact that some FHS "mandatory" directories are
    only created in the initial install (Closes: #242192).
  * Do not create /cdrom and /floppy anymore (Closes: #245188).
  * Use "ln -sf" to create /usr/local/man symlink (Closes: #245687).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Apr 2004 19:44:44 +0200

base-files (3.0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /var/log/btmp, following /etc/login.defs (Closes: #239587).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Mar 2004 13:40:46 +0100

base-files (3.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /srv, /media and /usr/local/share/man (Closes: #230909).
  * Added /usr/local/man as a symlink to /usr/local/share/man,
    since FHS says both directories should be "synonymous".
  * I'm not populating /media because subdirectories are optional.
    They only must exist "if the corresponding subsystem is installed".
    Detecting such things is not really base-files business. I would
    expect debian-installer to create those subdirectories instead.
  * /cdrom and /floppy will still be created in the first install until
    debian-installer and/or apt stop using them for new installs.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Feb 2004 17:47:34 +0100

base-files (3.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (3.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Prevent OSNAME from having the GNU/ prefix twice (Closes: #200741).

base-files (3.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (3.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed /etc/profile so that PS1 isn't set for non-interactive shells.
    This should make the usual way of testing for interactive shells
    (checking for PS1) to always work (Closes: #164846).
  * Changed /etc/motd to better reflect the truth about Debian: s/Most of//
    and s/freely redistributable/free software/ (Closes: #169543).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Nov 2002 22:06:12 +0100

base-files (3.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a small FAQ. The current topics are:
  - Why Debian does not have a profile.d directory?
  - I upgraded to testing, why /etc/issue does not read "testing"?
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.7 (do not create or remove doc symlinks).
    Note: In theory, packages still creating doc symlinks are allowed
    to blindly assume /usr/doc exists, so /usr/doc will still be part of
    base-files for some time.
  * Removed prerm, since it's not required anymore.

base-files (3.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/profile does no longer export PS1. This should prevent
    strange prompts to be shown when switching from bash to a shell which
    does not understand bash escapes (Closes: #141193).
  * Set distribution to "testing/unstable".

base-files (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wrong group ownerships under GNU/Hurd. This may also happen under
    Linux when using the `bsdgroups' mount option, but even in this case
    it will not happen if the package is built using fakeroot.

base-files (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    They are mentioned in FHS 2.1 and required in FHS 2.2 (Closes: #118505).

base-files (2.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * GPL is now a symlink to GPL-2, which is the real file.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun,  2 Sep 2001 13:26:34 +0200

base-files (2.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/info readline/info rluserman/ in /etc/inputrc (Closes: #109110).
  * Updated LGPL-2.1 from ftp.gnu.org to fix line breaks (Closes: #109319).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Aug 2001 17:29:10 +0200

base-files (2.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the first install, populate /usr/local even if it exists.
    Allows /usr/local to be mounted in a separate partition during the
    install process (Closes: #107662).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Aug 2001 19:09:16 +0200

base-files (2.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /var/state and /var/state/misc, added /usr/local/games.
    Reported by Sebastian Riedel.
  * Made /boot mode 755 and owned by root group, since no part of the system
    seems to require special permissions here (Closes: #102080).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Jun 2001 19:45:46 +0200

base-files (2.2.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Creates /etc/motd in the initial install (now made by debootstrap).
    Forgot to do this in 2.2.7. Reported by Matt Kraai (Closes: #101342).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jun 2001 14:38:33 +0200

base-files (2.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made /etc/debian_version a `conffile' (Closes: #81249). To prevent
    unneeded dpkg prompting, this file is overwritten in the preinst
    if upgrading from a base-files release previous to 2.2.6
    (thanks to Joey Hess for suggesting this solution).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Mar 2001 19:33:22 +0100

base-files (2.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * The file /etc/motd is no longer a conffile. Instead, it will be updated
    if its md5sum (minus its first two lines) matches the one in a list of
    md5sums of previous Debian releases. This will reduce dpkg prompting
    on upgrades (Closes: #71083).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 20:23:06 +0100

base-files (2.2.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use "testing/unstable" instead of "2.2" for the distribution number.
    It seems everybody prefers to see something else other than "2.2".

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Dec 2000 11:41:55 +0100

base-files (2.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified debian_version, issue and issue.net in /etc so that they
    read "2.2" again, since this is the last Debian *stable* release so far.
    Since packages in `unstable' are now automatically moved to `testing',
    a codename in /etc/debian_version will never be "right" for everybody, so
    the only sensible thing to do here is to wait until a new release number
    has been officially decided (Closes: #80784).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Dec 2000 20:40:05 +0100

base-files (2.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored LGPL -> LGPL-2.1 symlink, which was mistakenly removed
    in base-files_2.2.1 (Bug #75949).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Nov 2000 11:21:54 +0100

base-files (2.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /var/lib/misc, since it's required by FHS (Closes: Bug #74317).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Oct 2000 20:09:48 +0200

base-files (2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reduced verbosity, as suggested by Sean Perry (Closes: #70686).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 14:05:12 +0200

base-files (2.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release for woody (debian_version, issue and issue.net).
  * /etc/motd now refers to /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.
  * Removed /usr/doc/copyright and /usr/man.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jul 2000 13:20:17 +0200

base-files (2.2.0) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * The recipe in README.base does not work properly because dpkg
    removes the conffiles listed in the status file (Bug #64734).
    So, getting rid of base involves editing the status file.
    To avoid mistakes, a shell script is now provided for that.
    Thanks to Kevin Dalley <kevind@alacosta.org> for the report.

base-files (2.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * preinst and postinst: Do not deal with /dev/pts anymore.
  * issue and issue.net: Removed the `frozen' word.
  * Final release for potato (hopefully).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 24 Apr 2000 14:02:44 +0200

base-files (2.1.20) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Made /var/log mode 755 and root.root (Bug #35504).
  * Made /cdrom and /floppy mode 755 and root.root (Bug #25847).
  * Removed /dev/pts. It made the package impossible to upgrade when
    using devfs with Linux 2.4. libc6 is already supposed to deal
    with /dev/pts (Bug #61408).
  * postinst removes base.conffiles as well (otherwise, some files
    like /etc/motd or /root/.bash_profile may disappear).
    Thanks a lot to Mikko Oilinki for the report.
  * Slightly improved README.base.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue,  4 Apr 2000 17:31:01 +0200

base-files (2.1.19) frozen unstable; urgency=low

base-files (2.1.18) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle better the /var/spool/mail-being-a-symlink case.
  * Added /dev/pts for UNIX98-style pty handling under Linux.
  * Added a README.FHS.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon,  7 Feb 2000 18:29:00 +0100

base-files (2.1.17) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Some people has /var/spool/mail symlinked to somewhere else.
    For this case, preinst now saves the symlink target before dpkg
    removes it and postinst restores it.
  * Do not fiddle with /usr/local on upgrades. From now on, users
    will be free to remove it if they wish.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sat,  5 Feb 2000 20:10:17 +0100

base-files (2.1.16) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Generate default info dir file from /usr/share/base-files/info.dir.
  * Do not generate an info dir file if one exists at /usr/share/info.
  * Updated LGPL version 2 from ftp.gnu.org to fix a typo.
  * Mail spool is /var/mail as per FHS (only in new installs).
  * Acknowledge in the copyright file that the GNU Public Licenses are
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

base-files (2.1.15) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed misleading copyright notice in /etc/motd.
  * Distribution set to "2.2" (adding `frozen' in issue and issue.net).
  * Use DEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM for the architecture stuff wherever possible.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 28 Jan 2000 14:03:25 +0100

base-files (2.1.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Swap binary-arch and binary-indep targets in debian/rules, since this
    is now Architecture: any. Thanks to Roman Hodek for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Wed, 22 Dec 1999 19:48:24 +0100

base-files (2.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made "Architecture: any" for /etc/motd to be os-dependant.
    [ A binary-all-<os> scheme would simplify this ].
  * Exclude /proc from the .deb under GNU/Hurd (reported by Marcus Brinkmann).
  * Added `set -e' to postinst.
  * Standards-Version: 3.1.1 (doc symlinks).
  * Removed obsolete README. If someone still asks about /usr/spool or
    /var/adm then a paragraph could be added to the Debian FAQ.
  * Follow changes suggested by Branden Robinson:
  * Removed remaining bashisms in default /root/.profile and use
    /usr/bin/X11 for X11 binaries.
  * Improved package description.
  * Removed unused bin/edit in the source.
  * Changed root test in /etc/profile to use id -u.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 21 Dec 1999 11:53:35 +0100

base-files (2.1.12) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed Replaces field (reported a zillion times).
  * Updated /etc/profile to use '$ ' as the shell prompt for normal
    users and '# ' for the superuser if $BASH is not set.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 20 Dec 1999 12:56:18 +0100

base-files (2.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include /etc/inputrc and /etc/profile from readline and bash,

base-files (2.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create /var/log/lastlog as root.utmp, mode 664.
  * Removed Linuxisms from /etc/motd.
  * Updated GPL from ftp.gnu.org to be Y2K-compliant.

base-files (2.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the advertising clause from BSD license (Bug #43347).
    Reason: ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change
    Thanks to J.H.M. Dassen for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Thu, 26 Aug 1999 14:04:51 +0200

base-files (2.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added base-passwd (>= 2.0.3.4) to the Depends field.
  * utmp and wtmp are now root.utmp and mode 664 (Bug #41569).
  * Updated extended description regarding the common licenses.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 27 Jul 1999 14:03:23 +0200

base-files (2.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * LGPL is now the Lesser Gnu Public License (Bug #40759).
    For now, the old version is renamed to "LGPL-2".
  * Changed compatibility symlink /usr/doc/copyright/LGPL so that it
    points to the old version.
  * Moved docs to /usr/share/doc/base-files.
  * Changed default /etc/motd so that it refers both to /usr/doc/*/copyright
    and /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Fri, 16 Jul 1999 19:45:09 +0200

base-files (2.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * preinst: Do not fiddle with /etc/issue.net anymore.
  * Changed the way /cdrom, /floppy and /initrd are handled.
    These directories will now be created by postinst in the initial install.
    This is a compromise after discussing in debian-policy about Bug #35928.
    It will save people who like them the work of creating them after
    installing a new system, and it will save people who dislike them the
    work of removing them every time base-files is upgraded.
    Since these directories are only a convenience for the user, who
    is free to use them or not, the spirit of FHS is preserved.
  * preinst and postinst: Following the principle of least surprise,
    added code so that existing directories are not removed when upgrading
    this package from previous releases.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Tue, 20 Apr 1999 15:39:36 +0200

base-files (2.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (2.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

base-files (2.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved common licenses to /usr/share/common-licenses.
  * Default dotfiles for root are now installed only the first time.
  * /usr/local and subdirectories are now created mode 2775
    and root.staff, according to policy.
  * Added /usr/local/share.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 26 Oct 1998 19:05:04 +0100

base-files (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * If it does not exist, now a default /root/.profile file is installed,

base-files (2.0) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed the "frozen" word from /etc/debian_version.
  * Removed the use of the ROOT variable in preinst and postinst for two
    reasons: a) It is no longer needed, since the base system is built
    by using dpkg's --root=dir option, which works in a chrooted environment;
    and b) Unexpected results would be obtained if user root had actually
    defined a variable named ROOT.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Sun, 24 May 1998 13:33:25 +0200

base-files (1.9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Default prompt for root is now '\h:\w\$ '.
  * issue and issue.net: Removed the "frozen" word.

  * nsswitch.conf: Use "compat" instead of "db files" for passwd, group

base-files (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Depends: awk", so that awk is a "virtual essential package".
  * /root/.bash_profile and /root/.bashrc are not `conffiles' anymore.
    Instead, they are created from /root/.bash_profile.dpkg-dist and
    /root/.bashrc.dpkg-dist if they do not exist.
  * Default /root/.bash_profile sources /root/.bashrc.
  * PS1 and umask are now set only once in default /root/.bashrc.
  * Replaced /usr/bin/X11 by /usr/X11R6/bin in root's PATH.

  * Added a small comment in /etc/nsswitch.conf saying where
    to find documentation about this file (libc6-doc package).
  * Added some aliases for colorized `ls' commented out in .bashrc, so
    that the user will simply have to uncomment them.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>  Mon, 23 Feb 1998 18:42:28 +0100

base-files (1.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

base-files (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Default prompt for root is now PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ ', which may not
    please everybody and/or generate a flame war, but at least is better
    than nothing (previosuly it was PS1='\h\$ ').
  * Added two blank lines to /etc/motd to keep Copyright notice from being
    overwritten by /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh.
  * Removed compatibility symlinks /usr/spool, /usr/tmp, /usr/adm
    and /var/adm. Now is when we have to see if something breaks.
  * Removed /usr/lib/locale. Added /usr/share and /usr/include.

  * Updated GPL and LGPL. FSF's address changed some time ago to:
    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.

  * /etc/debian_version, /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net now read
