    + 0011-drm-Remove-unnecessary-reset_scan_out_buffer_if_need.patch:

       plymouth logo and text themes through alternatives even when we remove
       ubuntu-base ones.
      + debian/rules, debian/plymouth.{install,links), don't ship non
        non alternative-based theme policy files and tools.
      + update plymouth.README.Debian to tell to use update-alternative
        instead of set-default-theme
      + change debian/local/plymouth.hook to use update-alternative to get
        default theme instead of set-default-theme. Also, don't copy
        deleted files to initramfs.
    - Add Breaks: against older themes versions as they are shipping in /lib
      instead of /usr/share.
  * Noticeable changes from previous ubuntu version:
    - Follow debian in moving all renderers from /lib to /usr/lib 
    - Follow debian as well in moving all themes from /lib to /usr/share
      and handle transition removing older /lib/plymouth/theme generated files.
    - Renamed all ubuntu_logo* to ubuntu-logo* to follow debian naming. Do
      something comparable with all our assets and adapt scripts to it.
    - Renamed debian/libplymouth4.apport to debian/source_plymouth.apport
      as we install it under this name.
    - Cleaning up deprecated transitions in maintainer scripts and package
      metadata.
    - Log viewer has been disabled in upstream build for quite a while and
      is now not built either in debian. Follow this changes. We can re-enable
      it if there is a need but systemd logs should be generally enough.
    - Update ubuntu specific package description to match debian's one.
    - Following debian change, we disable plymouth splash with !nosplash as
      a kernel command parameter.
    - All patches needed some adapation as upstream changed its identation from
      2 to 8 space characters.
    - debian/plymouth-theme-ubuntu-text.postrm: clean up generated postinst
      ubuntu-text plymouth metafile.
    - we do select one default theme when no ubuntu related themes are
      installed from the default plymouth theme package (spinner theme). If
      you don't want to install an ubuntu plymouth theme and select another
      one from the default set manually, update the alternative.
    - add missing lsb-release dep on plymouth-theme-ubuntu-text
  * ubuntu old changelog containing debian-like packaging version has been
    copied to debian/changelog.ubuntu.old in the source package.

    clears only the current line before overwriting it with the password
    prompt. If the prompt is multilined then the last line ends up being
    overwritten but the previous lines are repeated. Re-printing only the
    last line of the password prompt on every keystroke. (LP: #566818)
  * details/plugin.c: Removed the explicit printing of ':'. Expected to be a
    part of the prompt.

  * Clean up the prerm scripts:
    - don't use this horrible case $1 meme that infests maintainer

    - avoid useless exit 0 at the end

    boilerplate in the remaining postrms.
  * debian/initramfs-tools/hooks/plymouth: don't overwrite /etc/passwd in
    the initramfs if it's already present, since ours is just there as an

  * gcc45-arith-workaround.patch: Add upstream bug link.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Backport a couple of patches from upstream to make debugging less
    painful:
    - Fix parsing of plymouth:debug=file:.
    - Handle plymouth:splash or plymouth:debug as last argument.
  * Rearrange patch handling in a way that doesn't cause dpkg-source to
    entirely shuffle the contents of debian/patches/debian-changes every
    time we upload, and to make it easier to merge in future:
    - Split debian-changes (mostly) into separate patches.  A small
      misc-changes.patch file remains with some patches I didn't have time
      to analyse, but the bulk of this can now be handled with separate
      quilt operations.  (As usual, if you don't use quilt, patches will end
      up in a debian-changes patch at the end of the patch series.)
    - Remove .pc from revision control; it's too noisy and hard to keep
      consistent.  Use
      http://people.canonical.com/~cjwatson/dpkg-quilt-setup after checking
      out from revision control to set up quilt.

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/plymouth.plymouth-stop.upstart: trust the new kdm to stop plymouth
    for us, too.  LP: #540177.
  * plymouth needs to depend on initramfs-tools to avoid calling

  * src/plugins/renderers/drm/plugin.c: temporarily disable the drm backend
    for nouveau, until we can get to the bottom of the DRM lockup in bug
    #539655.  This is not as pretty, but it boots to the desktop without
    hanging regardless of how many displays are used, and that takes
    precedence.  LP: #533135.

    and the necessary support in ply_pixel_display, ply_renderer and in

plymouth (0.8.1-1) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Update to the upstream 0.8.1 release:
    - Our patches have been merged upstream, some changes due to cleaning
      them up for submission and noticing a few bugs along the way.
      Remaining changes are:
      + ubuntu-logo theme
      + ubuntu version of the text theme
      + call update-initramfs rather than plymouth-update-initrd in
        plymouth-set-default-theme
      + filter fsck progress updates from the progress bar tracker
      + watch for enter key press
      + support lbm-nouveau as an alternate driver name for nouveau to
        permit backports once Lucid has released
      + use /dev/fb0 as default framebuffer device name
      + stop animation of script plugin in idle function
    - Will become process group leader of its VT if possible (opens without
      O_NOCTTY when redirecting stdio to it), this is almost certainly
      correct keyboard-wise.
    - Deallocates VT on "plymouth quit" after switching VT back to VT1
    - Open terminal in text and details plugin, don't assume it's already
      open.
    - Calling "plymouth quit" or "plymouth deactivate" while the same
      command is already running will now block the new command until the
      old one complete, rather than returning immediately.
    - Various window fixes for script plugin
    - Script plugin updated to use the window X and Y offsets every time
    - Plymouth client tool has been updated to have commands for many cases
      in preference to the --command style.

  * Restored code to disable Plymouth's graphical plugins when an alternate
    init= is given on the kernel command-line, otherwise init=/bin/bash
    doesn't work so well when Plymouth is in the initramfs.
  * Restored crash handler that dumps boot messages to /dev/tty1.

  * Split themes out into different packages, reducing the size of the
    Plymouth package.  This also means that you can remove the themes
    packages to remove the "graphical splash" part of Plymouth while keeping
    the ability to prompt for questions on the console.
  * Use the alternatives system to select the default themes.  The existing
    symlink will be replaced on upgrade if you have not changed it.
  * Also use alternatives to select the text theme.
  * Restore the upstream text theme, renaming ours to "ubuntu-text".
  * Fallback to the built-in details theme (boot messages on console, but
    with the ability to prompt for questions) if no theme package is
    installed.
  (LP: #507238)

    Unfortunately these changes mean that if you've selected a custom
    theme, you will need to install that package and select it again.
    Sorry about that.

  * Include the 16-color VGA frame-buffer renderer.  LP: #526892.

  * Fix text, ubuntu-text and details themes to restore the console to text
    mode when adding text displays.

  * debian/rules:
    - Set default tty for boot and shutdown with configure arguments
    - Set default background color to the Ubuntu Aubergine, this provides
      some consistency with other default themes.
  * debian/plymouth.upstart, debian/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/plymouth:
    - Redirect console output to Plymouth, this will be both logged and made
      available to splash themes that want it (details by default).
      LP: #535108.
  * debian/plymouth.upstart, debian/plymouth.plymouth-splash.upstart:
    - Call show-splash from the plymouth script itself in the shutdown case.

  * ubuntu-logo theme:
    - Update in same manner as script has been to add Window.GetX() to
      math that centers things.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * ubuntu-logo theme:
    - fix the password prompt handling so the display of boot messages is
      restored after the passphrase has been entered, and subsequent password
      requests don't incorrectly reuse the previous prompt.  LP: #515822
    - turn the message_notification[0].y check right-way-round in

      Vishal Rao for this catch.  LP: #542458.
    - refactor get_message_label: the y position of the second line shouldn't
      vary according to its own height.  This brings the passphrase prompts
      from cryptsetup back up to where they should be.  LP: #539723.

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * src/libply-splash-core/ply-terminal.c:
    - To restore a terminal into Canonical Mode, rather than setting flags
      that happen to be the opposite of what cfmakeraw() removes, set the
      flags that stty's sane mode sets.
    - Ensure that we clear the "is unbuffered" flag on every exit path from
      ply_terminal_set_buffered() that means the terminal is Canonical Mode

  * src/libply-splash-core/ply-text-display.c:

plymouth (0.8.0~-15) lucid; urgency=low

  * debian/plymouth.upstart, debian/plymouth.plymouth-stop.upstart:
    - Replace the "stop on" clause in plymouth's own job with a job that
      handles stopping plymouth for the normal cases.

      For a display manager that handles the plymouth transition properly
      (gdm & ubiquity only at this point), this simply appears to be running
      until plymouth is stopped by that display manager.  This blocks plymouth
      from being stopped for other reasons, e.g. rc2 exiting.  LP: #538214.

      For other display managers, and when we reach the end of rc2 or
      other reasons, this simply asks plymouth to quit.  We never use
      --retain-splash, if the display manager can't do plymouth transitions,
      we never want to leave the VT in KD_GRAPHICS in case the display
      manager gets things wrong (hi, kdm!).  LP: #538524.
  * debian/plymouth.plymouth-splash.upstart:
    - Add LXDM.  LP: #526748

  * debian/plymouth.plymouth-splash.upstart:
    - Remove the "starting gdm" bit from the job, since that won't have any
      effect (job is already started by the time gdm is); and as a result of
      the above changes could end up with plymouth --show-splash and quit
      being called together if someone runs "start gdm" themselves.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * ubuntu_logo theme:
    - New logo from Otto Greenslade.
    - Switch off dots starting from the ones on the left instead of
      switching them off all at once.

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Move the Ubuntu logo up as discussed with Otto, this makes the mouse
    cursor appear between the logo and dots and solves the optical illusion
    of the logo being too low.  LP: #535014.
  * Don't include message about disk checks, which can come from mountall.
  * Drop the rc script splash functions, we don't want the SysV-rc compat
    stuff messing around with the splash screen - this can be entirely
    managed by Upstart now.  LP: #528787, #537262.

  * Plymouth Fix Mega Patch:
    - This hasn't yet been broken up into enough bits to send upstream, and
      doesn't *quite* address all the issues yet, but it's a major step.

    - Rewrite the VT handling, rather than abusing /dev/tty0 keep all VT
      operations on the actual VT (tty7), this avoids issues where we set
      the graphics mode of the wrong VT or put the wrong VT into VT_PROCESS
      mode.  LP: #520460, #522598, #526321, #533135
    - Don't attempt VT switch when using non-VT consoles.
    - Make VT mandatory for renderer plugins, so we fallback gracefully to
      text when the console is not a VT.  LP: #516825, #527083.
    - Restore VT when finished displaying the splash unless plymouth quit
      is called with --retain-splash.  LP: #506297.
    - Activate VT from text and details plugins, rather than haphardly in
      the main code, this means the textual boot is also on VT7.
      LP: #518352, #520122.
    - Add a --has-active-vt command that can let gdm inquire whether it
      should reuse Plymouth's VT; fixes the issue where Plymouth has no
      visible splash screen and X ends up on VT1.  LP: #519641, #533572.

    - Don't open terminal device in X11, fixes the issue where X will crash
      when debugging plugins using the X11 renderer.
    - Add --tty option to plymouthd for debugging when X is running and
      thus using an alternate VT.

    - Improve deactivate command so that the terminal is no longer watched
      for keyboard input, session is closed, etc.  LP: #528787, #531650.
    - Ignore mode changes while deactivated, otherwise we can end up
      resetting the VT back into text mode while X is starting up.
      LP: #523788, #502509.

    - Fix races with simultaneous quit and deactivate commands, or multiples
      of those commands.
    - Ignore --show-splash, --hide-splash, etc. commands while deactivated.
    - Add reactivate command for testing purposes.

    - Don't scan out drm buffer contents to fbcon when not called with
      quit --retain-splash.  LP: #527180.

    - Avoid resetting the terminal to unbuffered mode on every write, this
      results in setting X's VT into raw mode and results in the X server
      crashing on key presses.  LP: #532047, #534861, #519460, #520593,
      #522974, #525393

  * I'm aware that if you see the TEXT plugin, it's possible for Enter to
    still crash the X server for some people.  I will be opening a new bug
    for this, and would appreciate details from people affected.

  * If you have issues with Enter crashing the X server, and you see a
    GRAPHICAL plugin, check that gdm is up to date - if it is, please
    file new bugs.

  * I'm also aware of an issue where after boot, rather than seeing an X
    server, you see the ordinary "login:" getty screen.  Pressing Alt+F7
    should take you to X.  I will be opening a new bug for this, and would
    appreciate details from people affected.

  * Don't send fsck progress updates to the boot-duration file.
  * Make all the dots orange just before starting the X server.

  * Cute text-version of the splash screen.
    - Added basic support for fsck notification.
    - Added support for showing keys information on separate lines.

plymouth (0.8.0~-8) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Include label.so in the initramfs, as well as the font support files it
    depends on, needed for any text prompts or messages.  This will bloat the
    initramfs substantially (about 3MB) and impact boot performance as a
    result, but the solution to that is to not include plymouth in the
    initramfs unless we know it's needed for prompting (e.g., cryptsetup).
    LP: #496765.
  * Move x11 renderer into a separate package, to avoid pulling GTK into the
    server install by default.  LP: #509579.
  * debian/rules: fix up the dh_makeshlibs exclude path to match where we're
    currently installing.
  * src/plugins/splash/script/plugin.c: the script plugin has no support at
    all for text consoles, so if there are no pixel displays available,
    return an error so that plymouth can fall back to the text plugin.
    LP: #506717.
  * Always include the 'details' and 'text' themes in the initramfs, since
    plymouth uses these as built-in fallbacks and they're tiny.
  * src/main.c: when a splash plugin fails to load, make sure to unregister
    any related keyboard handlers.
  * don't let the password walk off the end of the dialog box.  LP: #496782.
  * split the plymouth upstart job into plymouth and plymouth-splash, so that
    plymouth starts up early and doesn't have to race gdm; and stop
    unconditionally adding plymouth to the initramfs now that we can start it
    this way.
  * debian/plymouth.postinst: also set the theme on first install, or on
    upgrade from versions prior to 0.8.0~-7, because update-initramfs called
    before plymouth has been configured for the first time will accidentally
    cause a call to --reset to use the text theme instead of the intended
    default.
  * debian/plymouth.plymouth-splash.upstart: don't wait on tty-device-added,
    these are now guaranteed to be available; copied from gdm upstart job.
  * Depend on mountall (>= 2.0) to ensure we have the above guarantee.
  * Mark /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/plymouth executable,
    otherwise initramfs-tools skips it.  LP: #509487.
  * Drop the Debian revision (-1) from the version in the symbols file, to

    for the transition, we want to use our current framebuffer instead.
    Other bugs (with the VT code) are preventing that transition from working.
  * Fix a crash on "plymouth deactivate" when no renderer is active.

  * debian/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/plymouth:
    - Don't check the kernel command-line; we always want plymouth running
      whether or not "splash" is present, plymouth uses that to determine
      which of the graphics or text renderers to use.

  * Disabled the crash handler, since it does something very silly when

  * Added initramfs conf that enables the framebuffer and plymouth unless

    to the point where we can start plymouth in the real system just as
    fast, while HDD-based systems have to do ureadahead first and we want
    something pretty on screen while that happens.
