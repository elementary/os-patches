flatpak (1.14.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Add dependency on fuse3, for fusermount3.
    Strictly speaking this is only needed for system installations, but
    those are the default, and a missing fusermount3 produces unclear
    symptoms.
  * d/control: Depend on polkitd in preference to transitional policykit-1.
    This package doesn't need pkexec.
  * Update Lintian overrides

flatpak (1.14.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * d/copyright: Update
  * Build with libfuse3

flatpak (1.13.3-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Build with libcurl http backend.
    This avoids library conflicts during the transition to GNOME 43, in
    which core apps and libraries have switched to libsoup3, which conflicts
    with libsoup2.4. See #1016589.
  * d/control: Remove backwards-compat with libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev.
    libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-dev was released in bullseye, and official backports
    to old distributions need to swap the dependency anyway, because of
    how buildds resolve alternative dependencies.
  * Set correct Vcs-Git field for experimental branch
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.1 (no changes required)

flatpak (1.12.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable release
  * Alter the solution to CVE-2022-21682 to avoid regressions:
    - Revert semantics of --nofilesystem=host to be the same as 1.12.2
    - Revert semantics of --nofilesystem=home to be the same as 1.12.2
    - Add --nofilesystem=host:reset which means the same thing that
      --nofilesystem=host did in 1.12.3
    - Users of flatpak-builder should update it to 1.2.2 to resolve
      CVE-2022-21682
  * Other bug fixes:
    - Clarify documentation related to CVE-2022-21682
    - Improve test coverage related to CVE-2022-21682
    - Restore compatibility with older appstream-glib versions, for backports
  * Set high urgency to resolve regressions in 1.12.3

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:01:05 +0000

flatpak (1.12.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream stable release
  * Security fixes:
    - Prevent a malicious repository from arranging for permissions to be
      granted without being correctly displayed during installation
      (CVE-2021-43860, GHSA-qpjc-vq3c-572j)
    - Prevent a malicious build in flatpak-builder creating directories
      outside the build directory (CVE-2022-21682, GHSA-8ch7-5j3h-g4fx)
  * Behaviour changes, as a result of how CVE-2022-21682 was fixed:
    - --nofilesystem=host is now special-cased to negate all --filesystem
      permissions. Previously, it would cancel out --filesystem=host but
      not --filesystem=/some/dir.
    - --nofilesystem=home is now special-cased to negate several
      home-directory-related filesystem permssions such as
      --filesystem=xdg-config/foo, not just --filesystem=host.
  * Other bug fixes:
    - Extra-data downloading now properly handles compressed
      content-encodings, which fixes checksum verification
    - Avoid unnecessary polkit prompt due to auto-pinning when installing
      runtimes
    - Better handling of updates of extensions that exist in multiple
      repositories
    - Fixed (initial) installation of apps with renamed app-IDs
    - Support more pulseaudio configuration, including the one used in WSL2
    - Fixed regression in updates from no-enumerate remotes
    - We now verify checksums of summary caches, to better handle local file
      corruption
    - Improved CLI output for non-terminal targets
    - Flatpak run --session-bus now works
    - Fix build with PyParsing >= 3.0.4
    - bash auto completion now doesn't complete on command name aliases
    - Minor improvements to the search command
    - Minor improvements to the list command
    - Minor improvements to the repair command
    - Add more tests
    - Updated translations and docs
  * d/copyright: Update

flatpak (1.12.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * flatpak Recommends xdg-user-dirs.
    If we don't have this, the XDG special directories for documents, music,
    downloads etc. will not be listed in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs unless
    configured manually; this means that app permissions that would normally
    share those directories with the host, such as --filesystem=xdg-download,
    will have no practical effect. (Closes: #1000609)
  * Build/test-depend on dbus-daemon.
    We don't necessarily need a full implementation for the unit tests, but
    we do need to be able to run dbus-daemon --session.
  * Depend on default-dbus-system-bus | dbus-system-bus instead of dbus.
    Any implementation of the system bus will do.
  * Adjust Lintian overrides for current Lintian

    prevented. Resolving this with older libseccomp versions will require
    further development.
  * Add CVE-2021-41133 reference in previous changelog entry
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.0 (no changes required)

    - When an app uses flatpak-spawn --env=... --forward-fd=..., ensure
      that the file descriptors do not collide, which could result in the
      subsandbox failing to launch or being launched with wrong environment
      variables. (Closes: #989935)

flatpak (1.10.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/patches: Align with upstream flatpak-1.10.x branch, making this
    effectively a release candidate for upstream stable release 1.10.3
    - d/patches: Update metadata to reflect upstream flatpak-1.10.x branch.
      All the patches we apply in Debian are expected to be released in
      1.10.3 upstream, but not all were annotated to reflect this.
    - d/p/system-helper-Fix-deploys-of-local-remotes.patch:
      Fix some failures to update in GNOME Software and the unit tests.
      This change was previously applied in Ubuntu's flatpak_1.10.2-1ubuntu1
      to fix a unit test failure, possibly triggered by a newer version of
      GLib. It has also been reported to fix a failure to upgrade Flatpak
      apps using GNOME Software, this time in Fedora.
    - d/p/create-usb-Skip-copying-extra-data-flatpaks.patch:
      Skip flatpaks with "extra-data" when using `flatpak create-usb`.
      This command is intended to create USB drives that can be
      used to install Flatpak apps and/or runtimes while offline,
      but the "extra-data" feature downloads extra content for an app
      or runtime at install time, as a way to automate installation of
      data that can be re-downloaded by end users but is not licensed
      for redistribution by Flatpak repositories. Such apps and runtimes
      would fail to install while offline.
    - d/p/series: Re-order patches to match upstream flatpak-1.10.x branch

    - d/p/portal-Use-a-GArray-to-store-fds.patch,
      d/p/portal-Remap-env-fd-into-child-process-s-fd-space.patch:
      When an app uses flatpak-spawn --env=... --forward-fd=..., ensure
      that the file descriptors do not collide, which could result in the
      subsandbox failing to launch or being launched with wrong environment
      variables. (Closes: #989935)

  * d/p/tests-Remove-hard-coded-references-to-x86_64.patch:
    Add proposed patch to fix some tests on non-x86_64 machines.
    The affected tests were already skipped in schroot/lxc for other
    reasons, but would be run (and fail) on autopkgtest testbeds with

flatpak (1.8.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/p/Skip-parental-controls-checks-on-ServiceUnknown-or-NameHa.patch:
    Add proposed patch to skip parental controls if accountsservice is not
    installed.
    The malcontent package (which activates parental controls support)
    depends on accountsservice, but the libmalcontent-0-0 client library
    does not, so we need to cope gracefully with the case where
    neither malcontent nor accountsservice is installed. Presumably, in such
    installations the sysadmin did not want the parental controls feature.
    Ideally libmalcontent would do this itself (#972145). (Closes: #972138)
  * Add Depends on dbus, for the well-known system bus service.
    Now that the parental controls feature is enabled, Flatpak will refuse
    to run apps if the D-Bus system bus is unavailable. Previously, it would
    have partially worked (but with severely reduced functionality, in
    particular only --user installations).
  * d/control: Canonicalize case of Multi-Arch
  * Update lintian overrides to silence some false-positives

flatpak (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable release
    - Update configure options
    - Install gdm env.d fragment, but only as an example file.
      It is harmful on systems where environment.d(5) works (in particular
      systems using systemd), because it overwrites additions to the
      XDG_DATA_DIRS coming from other app frameworks like Snap.
      However, using either this fragment or manual configuration might
      be necessary on non-systemd systems. See
      /usr/share/doc/flatpak/README.Debian for more details.

  * New upstream development release
    - Sideloading apps now works differently.
      Flatpak no longer supports installing from local network peers, and
      sideloading from a local USB drive is no longer automatic.
      Instead of being configured via `flatpak config sideload-repos`,
      enabling sideloading is now done by creating a symbolic link in
      /var/lib/flatpak/sideload-repos or /run/flatpak/sideload-repos.

flatpak (1.7.0~git20200330-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream snapshot
    - d/copyright: Update
    - Drop all patches, applied upstream
  * Revert "d/control: Add spurious Build-Conflicts on elogind packages".
    experimental buildds now use aptitude rather than aspcud, so this
    particular workaround shouldn't be necessary, even in experimental.
  * Explicitly build-depend on python3-pyparsing.
    This is required to generate the variant schema compiler.
  * d/p/variant-schema-compiler-Disable-optimized-calculation-of-.patch:
    Disable optimized calculation of offset size.
    This doesn't seem to be completely portable, and it isn't clear why not,
    so disable it until we have more answers.

    - d/control, d/gbp.conf: Use debian/experimental packaging branch
    - d/gbp.conf: Use upstream/latest branch
    - d/watch: Watch for development releases
  * New upstream snapshot

    variant-schema-compiler
  * Update symbols file
  * d/patches: Add patches proposed upstream to formalize deprecations
    and fix rebuild of generated files
  * d/control: Add spurious Build-Conflicts on elogind packages.
    As in 1.5.0-1, this works around a build-dependency resolver failure
    when using the same aspcud resolution behaviour as official Debian
    experimental buildds, and can safely be reverted in distributions
    that only have elogind, such as Devuan.

flatpak (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable release
    - d/p/testlibrary-Don-t-assert-that-progress-is-signalled.patch:
      Drop workaround, the leaks that broke this test have been fixed
    - Drop other patches, applied upstream
    - Bump xdg-desktop-portal dependency to 1.6.x.
      That version has new API which Flatpak apps might rely on, so the
      corresponding versions should be tested and backported together.
  * d/watch: Only watch for stable releases
  * Set upstream branch to upstream/1.6.x
  * Drop xdg-desktop-portal from Depends to Recommends.
    Installing xdg-desktop-portal 1.6.x is strongly recommended, but
    strictly speaking it is not required: some of the simpler Flatpak
    apps can work without it. (Closes: #947022)
  * tests: Depend on fuse and policykit-1
  * Revert Build-Conflicts on elogind to be nice to non-systemd derivatives.
    This was a workaround for the build-dependency resolver used in
    experimental, and is unnecessary now that I'm targeting unstable.

    This works around a build-dependency resolver failure when using
    the same aspcud resolution behaviour as official Debian experimental
    buildds, which for some reason tries to co-install systemd and elogind,
    causing failure to install build-dependencies.

  * Install flatpak-docker-seccomp.json to /u/s/d/flatpak/examples.
    This seccomp profile can be used to configure a Docker container to
    allow bubblewrap and Flatpak to be run, with some caveats:
    - The host kernel must allow unprivileged user namespace creation
      (for example Debian with sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1,
      or recent Ubuntu in its default configuration)
    - Use the seccomp profile
      (docker run --security-opt seccomp=flatpak-docker-seccomp.json)

  * d/autogen.sh: Run gtkdocize --copy. Plain gtkdocize replaces
    gtk-doc.make with a symlink, which dh_autoreconf_clean won't remove,
    breaking the ability to build twice in a row from the same directory.

    The version in oldstable doesn't support build profiles. Strictly
    speaking 0.15 might be enough, but I'm not going to test with anything
    older than oldstable-backports.
  * d/tests/gnome-desktop-testing: Clear proxy-related environment
    variables, as was previously done for ostree. These are set on
    Ubuntu's infrastructure to allow accessing the Internet (which we
    don't need), at the cost of breaking access to 127.0.0.1 (which we
    do need) for anything that doesn't respect $no_proxy (in
    particular libostree). (Closes: #880043)

  * New upstream stable release
    - Update symbols file
  * Disable gtk-doc if we are not going to build libflatpak-doc,
    in particular for architecture-specific builds. Note that it remains
    in Build-Depends (not Build-Depends-Indep) because it is also needed
    for gtkdocize during dh_autoreconf.
  * Do not force --disable-silent-rules, debhelper does this now
  * Install gtk-doc documentation to the standard /usr/share/gtk-doc,
    with a symbolic link in /usr/share/doc, instead of the other way
    round. The gtk-doc documentation is functionally significant (it
    affects cross-reference generation during build of other packages)
    so according to Policy §12.3 it is not appropriate for
    /usr/share/doc.
    - Install dpkg-maintscript-helper fragments for this migration
  * Disable documentation generation under nodoc DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
  * Disable libflatpak-doc under nodoc build profile

    Manifest files are not part of core Flatpak, and are only used by

  * Install flatpak-bisect as an example in flatpak, not as a public
    entry point in flatpak-builder. It will not be in flatpak-builder
    after the projects are separated upstream, and does not seem
    important enough to justify a python3 dependency in flatpak or a

flatpak (0.9.1+git20170403.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream snapshot, to merge the same fixes that are in 0.8.5
    - Build-depend on libgpgme-dev
    - Update d/copyright
    - Don't (build-)depend on ostree-tests any more, ostree trivial-httpd
      is no longer required for the tests
    - Install a new man page

flatpak (0.8.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix release
  * Upstream security fixes:
    - dbus-proxy: Fix a use-after-free (no specific exploit is known)
      and several memory leaks
    - system-helper: Correct the check that was meant to prevent
      unprivileged users from downgrading system-wide-installed apps
    - Do not allow downgrading apps to validly-signed older versions
      unless a specific older version is requested, so that a
      man-in-the-middle cannot cause a downgrade to an older app
      version with a vulnerability
  * Other upstream fixes:
    - Increase GLib build-dependency to 2.44 (in practice this was
      already required, there is a patch in jessie-backports to
      relax this)
    - Collect system extension references from all system directories,
      not just the first that exists (upstream issue 654)
    - Stop using ostree trivial-httpd, which is not available in
      post-stretch ostree (upstream issues 658, 723)
    - Be build-time compatible with post-stretch ostree (upstream
      issue 756)
    - Strip ?query suffix before detecting whether a URI points to a
      .flatpakref or .flatpakrepo file (upstream issue 659)
    - Fix a typo in help output
  * d/tests/control: most tests now require python, for the
    ostree-trivial-httpd replacement

    - Adjust install files for rename of `flatpak remote-list` to
      `flatpak remotes`

  * flatpak Recommends xdg-desktop-portal-gtk | xdg-desktop-portal-backend,
    so that sandboxed apps can communicate with the outside world
  * Build-depend on ostree-tests and make flatpak-tests depend on it,
    for ostree trivial-httpd

flatpak (0.8.4-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upload to unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Mar 2017 18:43:51 +0000

flatpak (0.8.4-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Explicitly build-depend on automake. Otherwise, the aspcud resolver
    used in experimental sometimes chooses automake1.11 as the best
    solution to dh-autoreconf's dependency on automake | automaken,
    causing FTBFS.
    - Set the dependency to 1.14.1 since flatpak is known to build
      successfully with that version in jessie-backports, whereas older
      versions are not known to work.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Mar 2017 13:59:18 +0000

flatpak (0.8.4-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix release
    - Don't add flatpak directories to XDG_DATA_DIRS if already present
    - Do add flatpak directories to XDG_DATA_DIRS if it already has
      a non-default value
    - Improve progress estimates and reporting for UI frontends
    - Fill in many missing options in man pages
    - Support extensions that apply to multiple versions, particularly
      useful for OpenGL drivers
    - Support extensions that do not depend on any specific runtime,
      particularly useful for proprietary OpenGL drivers packaged with
      a static binary helper
    - Various fixes for error checking and crashes
    - Make flatpak_get_system_installations() return an array that owns
      (takes responsibility for freeing) its contents. This is
      technically an ABI break, but it makes this function consistent
      with others that have a similar signature, and nothing in Debian
      uses it yet.
    - Disable spliced reads in the FUSE file system, which don't appear
      to work
    - Make FamilyWild xauth tokens available in the sandbox, not
      just FamilyLocal
    - Fix a misleading message on systems without systemd --user:
      it now disables an optional feature without breaking sandboxing
  * Add patch simplifying profile.d snippet
  * Initially upload to experimental since this is relatively large
    for a stable-branch release

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Mar 2017 13:00:05 +0000

flatpak (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix release
    - fixes portals' ability to identify confined apps
      (Closes: #855129)
    - better support for third-party (proprietary) OpenGL drivers
    - better handling of errors for extra-data
    - handle extra-data properly for runtimes (as well as apps)
    - respect required version for runtimes (as well as apps)
    - flatpak list: Don't break if some local ref is not deployed
    - builder: Look for appstream data in /app/share/metadata also
    - builder: Fix buildsystem=cmake builds
    - Add progress reporting to extra-data download
    - Fix uid/gid for directories in document portal
  * Duplicate the profile.d snippet in /etc/X11/Xsession.d so it
    applies to X11 sessions, not just login shells. This matches the
    upstream intention: X11 sessions have traditionally run in a login
    shell on Red Hat derivatives, but not in Debian derivatives.

  * New upstream bugfix release
    - drop remaining patch, applied upstream
    - security fix: prevent writing to per-user-installed fonts
      and Flatpak extensions (typically locales)
  * d/control: flatpak-tests Recommends python, which is needed for
    one test (silencing a lintian warning)

flatpak (0.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/p/Use-seccomp-to-filter-out-TIOCSTI-ioctl.patch:
    Add patch from upstream to prevent contained apps from using
    TIOCSTI ioctl. This would let the app inject commands into the
    terminal from which it was invoked (CVE-2017-5226). This was
    initially fixed in bubblewrap by calling setsid(), but that
    breaks the ability to use Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+C on a flatpak-confined
    process, so it is being made optional; prevent the attack here
    instead, in a way that doesn't break shells.
  * d/p/Fix-update-of-standalone-bundle.patch:
    Add patch from upstream to fix updating an existing app with
    "flatpak install --bundle foo.flatpak"
  * d/p/Make-sure-var-tmp-is-not-on-tmpfs.patch:
    Add patch from upstream to mount ~/.var/APP/cache/tmp at /var/tmp
    inside the sandbox, so apps can rely on /var/tmp being on disk
  * d/p/Document-the-DefaultBranch-key.patch,
    d/p/Document-RuntimeRepo-key.patch:
    Add patches from upstream to fill in some missing documentation
  * d/p/testlibrary-ensure-that-contents_array-is-NULL-terminated.patch,
    d/p/tests-Install-testpython.py-executable.patch,
    d/p/tests-Move-the-test-repo-to-a-subdirectory-repos-test.patch:

    it too has more dependencies

flatpak (0.6.14-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/tests/*: only run tests on a real or virtual machine, not in a
    container. bubblewrap is effectively already a container, and
    nesting containers doesn't work particularly well.
    Unfortunately this means the tests won't work on ci.debian.net,
    which uses LXC.

flatpak (0.6.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This release drops source compatibility with Debian jessie. If
    you are building unofficial backports for older Debian derivatives,
    please base them on the debian/jessie-backports git branch instead of
    debian/master from now on.

  * d/control: rely on gtk-update-icon-theme, removing libgtk-3-bin
    alternative.
    - d/p/debian/Try-gtk-3.0-version-of-the-icon-cache-utility-first.patch:
      drop patch, this branch can now rely on having the plain
      gtk-update-icon-theme executable
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 10
    - do not explicitly build in parallel, it is now the default
    - do not explicitly enable autoreconf and systemd sequences, they
      are now the default
  * New upstream release

    - Drop all patches except
      d/p/debian/Try-gtk-3.0-version-of-the-icon-cache-utility-first.patch:
      all applied upstream
    - Demote libpam-systemd from Depends to Recommends. It is no longer
      mandatory to be running systemd --user, since flatpak 0.6.10
      identifies contained processes via their
      /proc/$pid/root/.flatpak-info instead of via cgroups
  * d/copyright: mention the Autoconf permissive license of acinclude.m4

  * New upstream release
    - d/control: libgsystem is no longer required
    - d/copyright: update for new libglnx
    - drop most patches, applied upstream
  * Drop unused build-dependency on docbook-xsl-doc-html.
    It is documentation about docbook-xsl, so isn't needed at build-time.
  * Expand build-dependencies to what we would use if no tests are skipped.
    In practice buildds disallow some of what the tests do, but we shouldn't
    rely on that.
  * d/patches: cherry-pick various post-release bug fixes from upstream
  * Build-depend on attr, and make flatpak-tests depend on it, for better
    test coverage if /var/tmp supports xattrs
  * Build-depend on fuse, so we can run fusermount if supported
  * Make flatpak-tests depend on ostree instead of using d/tests/control
  * d/p/make-test-runtime-cope-with-Debian-s-Python-2.7-configura.patch,
    add patch to make more build-time tests pass
  * d/p/Tell-build-time-tests-which-bwrap-we-are-going-to-use.patch:
    skip tests that cannot be run because we are in an environment where
    bwrap fails
  * d/p/test_install_launch_uninstall-consistently-check-for-GErr.patch:
    add patch to improve diagnostics on some test failures
  * d/p/document-portal-cope-with-multiple-events-that-would-caus.patch:
    in the document portal, don't crash if there is more than one reason
    to exit
  * Remove unused lintian overrides
  * Add lintian override for flatpak-system-helper.service.
    It is deliberately missing an [Install] section (so enabling it for
    eager startup is not possible), because it is intended to be
    started via D-Bus activation.
  * d/p/Terminate-gpg-agent-after-using-it-for-tests.patch:
    add patch to terminate gpg-agent processes after use
  * Terminate any further stray gpg-agent processes when running tests

    with cleanup in response to the container's main process (which

    Both provide dwarf.h, which is all we really need; libdw-dev is
    the one that is used in various important packages, including systemd.
    We also require src:elfutils anyway, for libelf-dev. (Closes: #825191)
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: add
  * debian/gbp.conf: automatically merge upstream tag into imported source

flatpak (0.6.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - drop patches to bubblewrap, included in the submodule upstream
  * d/p/Try-gtk-3.0-version-of-the-icon-cache-utility-first.patch:
    add missing space between the tool's name and its --quiet argument
  * d/p/Treat-members-of-sudo-group-as-privileged.patch:
    use sudo, not wheel, as the group of administrative users
    - d/rules: alter the polkit policy on Ubuntu derivatives to treat
      the admin group as equivalent to sudo
  * d/rules: don't install bwrap setuid on Ubuntu. Ubuntu enables
    unprivileged user namespaces by default. (Closes: #825090)
  * d/p/Skip-tests-that-make-a-repository-if-var-tmp-lacks-user-x.patch:
    skip several tests if we can run bwrap, but cannot write extended
    attributes in /var/tmp, for example on an Ubuntu live system
  * Use dh_girepository to get correct ${gir:Depends}
  * Prefer gtk-update-icon-cache as provider of the binary of the same
    name, but still accept libgtk-3-bin for now, to be nice to backports

flatpak (0.6.0-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Build-depend on procps, for /bin/kill (used in the tests).
    This fixes FTBFS in a more up-to-date buildd schroot.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 22 May 2016 14:19:12 +0100

flatpak (0.6.0-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * debian/flatpak.postinst: initialize /var/lib/flatpak/repo
    as requested by upstream
  * debian/flatpak.postrm: remove /var/lib/flatpak/repo on purge
  * Use dh-systemd to restart flatpak-system-helper on upgrades
  * debian/tests/control: flatpak-builder test requires make
  * Add patches from bubblewrap bug #71 to the embedded copy of bwrap,
    fixing flatpak-builder on the normal configuration of Debian kernels
  * Change patch for gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 to fall back to
    gtk-update-icon-cache. This means it will still work when the
    Debian-specific gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 name is dropped.

flatpak (0.6.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Rename package from xdg-app to flatpak, following upstream rename
  * New upstream release
    - Remove patches, applied upstream
    - Add new build-dependency on libpolkit-gobject-1-dev
  * libflatpak-dev: depend on libflatpak0, not flatpak (Closes: #823328)
  * debian/copyright: update
  * Install bwrap (bubblewrap) helper tool setuid by default, so that
    the package works without further configuration (Closes: #823535)
    - note that an unreleased snapshot of bwrap is also available as
      src:bubblewrap; for now this package uses its bundled submodule,
      until we get a better idea of how closely these packages will
      need to track each other
  * Add autopkgtests for as-installed testing
  * Build-depend on dbus-x11: the tests explicitly use dbus-launch

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 04 May 2016 09:36:05 +0100

xdg-app (0.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * debian/patches/install-Only-set-current-for-apps-not-for-runtimes.patch:
    remove, no longer necessary (and wasn't applied)
  * debian/gbp.conf: use DEP-14 branch names
  * Correct ITP bug number in previous changelog entry (was #697477,
    should have been #813308)
  * Don't build-depend on fuse. The test that uses fuse appears to fail on
    buildds, possibly because the kernel module is blacklisted; it should
    automatically be skipped when fuse isn't installed.
  * debian/gbp.conf: disable numbered patches, to reduce diff noise when
    they get applied upstream
  * d/p/session-helper-connect-the-D-Bus-and-systemd-services.patch:
    link the D-Bus session service to the systemd user service
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.8 (no changes needed)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Apr 2016 09:06:11 +0100

xdg-app (0.5.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Prepare package for Debian (Closes: #813308)
  * Set the Utopia Maintenance Team as maintainer, with myself and
    Matthias Klumpp as uploaders
  * Add Vcs-Git, Vcs-Browser (in collab-maint git)
  * Remove unnecessary use of dh-exec
  * Remove -dbg package, rely on automatic dbgsym packages instead
  * debian/.gitignore: add
  * debian/copyright: fill in all copyright holders
  * Normalize packaging via `wrap-and-sort -abst`
  * Adjust Section for the packages
  * Run the tests with VERBOSE=1
  * Install the new systemd user services
  * Run dh_install with --fail-missing to catch mistakes
  * Rename libxdgapp to the correct libxdg-app0 corresponding to
    libxdg-app.so.0
  * Rename libxdgapp-dev to libxdg-app-dev for consistency
  * Stop disabling the test that relies on FUSE; it is now correctly
    skipped if appropriate
  * Re-enable gtk-doc and add a libxdg-app-doc package
  * Add libxdg-app0.symbols
  * Add missing development dependencies
  * Set ${libexecdir} to /usr/lib/xdg-app, to avoid the toolchain getting
    confused by PIE executables in ${libexecdir} and treating them as
    incorrectly-named shared libraries
  * xdg-app-builder: reduce non-mandatory build tools to Recommends
  * xdg-app-builder: do not depend on tar, which is Essential
  * Fill in better values for Description
  * Depend on libpam-systemd (i.e. a working systemd-logind),
    because xdg-app currently relies on systemd to put user processes
    in cgroups
  * Run tests once via check-TESTS, but do not run them a second time
    via gtester, which fails because all test-cases in one test might
    be skipped
  * debian/control: document how to enable user namespaces
  * Only build for Linux: this package is specifically not portable
