    - In circumstances involving long-running scripts that create and reap many

      statuses from asynchronous processes to develop loops. This patch fixes
      the loop causes and adds code to detect any future loops.
    - A SIGINT received inside a SIGINT trap handler can possibly cause the
      shell to loop.
    - There are cases where a failing readline command (e.g., delete-char at
      the end of a line) can cause a multi-character key sequence to `back up'
      and attempt to re-read some of the characters in the sequence.
    - When sourcing a file from an interactive shell, setting the SIGINT handle
      to the default and typing ^C will cause the shell to exit.

bash (4.3-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Apply upstream patches 012 - 022, fixing the issues:
    - When a SIGCHLD trap runs a command containing a shell builtin while a
      script is running `wait' to wait for all running children to complete,
      the SIGCHLD trap will not be run once for each child that terminates.
    - Using reverse-i-search when horizontal scrolling is enabled does not
      redisplay the entire line containing the successful search results.
    - Under certain circumstances, $@ is expanded incorrectly in contexts
      where word splitting is not performed.
    - When completing directory names, the directory name is dequoted twice.
      This causes problems for directories with single and double quotes in
      their names.
    - An extended glob pattern containing a slash (`/') causes the globbing
      code to misinterpret it as a directory separator.
    - The code that creates local variables should not clear the `invisible'
      attribute when returning an existing local variable.  Let the code that
      actually assigns a value clear it.
    - When assigning an array variable using the compound assignment syntax,
      but using `declare' with the rhs of the compound assignment quoted, the
      shell did not mark the variable as visible after successfully performing
      the assignment.
    - The -t timeout option to `read' does not work when the -e option is used.
      LP: #1317476.
    - When PS2 contains a command substitution, here-documents entered in an
      interactive shell can sometimes cause a segmentation fault.
    - When the readline `revert-all-at-newline' option is set, pressing newline
      when the current line is one retrieved from history results in a double
      free and a segmentation fault. Closes: #747341.
    - Using nested pipelines within loops with the `lastpipe' option set can
      result in a segmentation fault.
  * Fix typo in package description. Closes: #707810.

    - Fix a problem with unsigned sign extension when attempting to reallocate
      the input line when it is fewer than 3 characters long and there has been
      a history expansion.  The sign extension causes the shell to not
      reallocate the line, which results in a segmentation fault when it writes
      past the end.
    - Change the behavior of programmable completion to compensate for two
      assumptions made by the bash-completion package.
    - The signal handling changes to bash and readline (to avoid running any
      code in a signal handler context) cause the cursor to be placed on the
      wrong line of a multi-line command after a ^C interrupts editing.

bash (4.3-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Apply upstream patches 001 - 008:
    - A missing check for a valid option prevented `test -R' from working.
      There is another problem that causes bash to look up the wrong variable
      name when processing the argument to `test -R'.
    - A change to save state while running the DEBUG trap caused pipelines to
      hang on systems which need process group synchronization while building
      pipelines.
    - When in callback mode, some readline commands can cause readline
      to segfault by passing invalid contexts to callback functions.
    - The `.' command in vi mode cannot undo multi-key commands beginning with
      `c', `d', and `y' (command plus motion specifier).
    - When in Posix mode, bash did not correctly interpret the ANSI-C-style
      $'...' quoting mechanism when performing pattern substitution word
      expansions within double quotes.
    - A shell that started with job control active but was not interactive left
      the terminal in the wrong process group when exiting, causing its parent
      shell to get a stop signal when it attempted to read from the terminal.
    - Using compound assignments for associative arrays like
        assoc=( [x]= [y]=bar )
      left the value corresponding to the key `x' NULL.  This caused
      subsequent lookups to interpret it as unset.
    - Some extended glob patterns incorrectly matched filenames with a leading
      dot, regardless of the setting of the `dotglob' option.
  * Replace already applied patches by the upstream patch files.

      they happened when the file descriptor was closed, rather than on write

    - Process substitution incorrectly inherited a flag that inhibited using the

bash (4.2-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Apply upstream patches 030 - 036, fixes for
    - When attempting to glob strings in a multibyte locale, and those strings
      contain invalid multibyte characters that cause mbsnrtowcs to return 0,
      the globbing code loops infinitely.
    - A change between bash-4.1 and bash-4.2 to prevent the readline input hook
      from being called too frequently had the side effect of causing delays
      when reading pasted input on systems such as Mac OS X.  This patch fixes
      those delays while retaining the bash-4.2 behavior.
    - Bash-4.2 has problems with DEL characters in the expanded value of
      variables used in the same quoted string as variables that expand
      to nothing.
    - Bash uses a static buffer when expanding the /dev/fd prefix for the test
      and conditional commands, among other uses, when it should use a dynamic
      buffer to avoid buffer overflow.
    - In bash-4.2, the history code would inappropriately add a semicolon to
      multi-line compound array assignments when adding them to the history.
    - When given a number of lines to read, `mapfile -n lines' reads
      one too many.
    - Bash-4.2 produces incorrect word splitting results when expanding
      double-quoted $@ in the same string as and adjacent to other variable
      expansions.  The $@ should be split, the other expansions should not.

bash (4.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patches 025 - 029, fixes for
    - When used in a shell function, `declare -g -a array=(compound assignment)'
      creates a local variable instead of a global one.
    - The `lastpipe' option does not behave correctly on machines where the
      open file limit is less than 256.
    - When the `extglob' shell option is enabled, pattern substitution does not
      work correctly in the presence of multibyte characters.
    - When using a word expansion for which the right hand side is evaluated,
      certain expansions of quoted null strings include spurious ^? characters.
    - Bash-4.2 tries to leave completed directory names as the user typed them,
      without expanding them to a full pathname.  One effect of this is that
      shell variables used in pathnames being completed (e.g., $HOME) are left
      unchanged, but the `$' is quoted by readline because it is a special
      character to the shell. This patch introduces two things:
      - A new shell option, `direxpand', which, if set, attempts to emulate the
        bash-4.1 behavior of expanding words to full pathnames during
        completion;
      - A set of heuristics that reduce the number of times special characters
        such as `$' are quoted when the directory name is not expanded.

    - bash.preinst:
      - Make sure /bin/sh is present and points to an executable, forcibly
        creating symlinks /bin/sh -> bash and /usr/share/man/man1/sh.1.gz ->
        bash.1.gz if not.
      - Divert /bin/sh and sh.1.gz on behalf of dash if we are upgrading from
        a bash version with /bin/sh in the files list and bash's copy of
        /bin/sh is not already diverted. This ensures unpacking bash will not
        cause /bin/sh to go missing.
  * bash.postinst: Simplify comment that contained an implementation detail
    about how /bin/sh is provided.

    - The bash getcwd replacement will write past the end of allocated memory
      when it allocates the buffer itself if it uses the buffer size passed
      as an argument, and that size is less than the length of the pathname.
    - Bash incorrectly puts the second and subsequent children spawned by a
      shell forked to run a command substitution in the wrong process group.
    - When initializing a subshell, bash did not reset a sentinel keeping
      track of the number of command substitutions, leading to an infinite
      loop if an error was encountered in the subshell.
    - Bash inappropriately evaluates command substitutions while expanding
      directory names as part of command substitution.
    - When reading input lines into a single variable using the `read' builtin,
      bash did not free the memory it read after assigining it to the named
      variable, causing a memory leak noticable when reading large amounts of
      data.

bash (3.2-0ubuntu12) hardy; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patches 026 - 033. Fixes for:
    - Keep the Apple linker from attempting to link bash against Apple's
      readline library "replacement" rather than the one shipped with bash.
    - When updating the display after displaying, for instance, a list
      of possible completions, readline will place the cursor at the wrong
      position if the prompt contains invisible characters and a newline.
      LP: #119938.
    - Under some circumstances, readline will incorrectly display a prompt
      string containing invisible characters after the final newline.
    - When the bash arithmetic expression evaluator has temporarily turned off
      evalation, such as when parsing a pre- or post-decrement or -increment
      operator, and an error occurs, evaluation is not re-enabled.
    - If redirections attached to a compound command fail, bash does not set
      the command's exit status correctly.  This only happens when the command
      is the first in a sequential list.
    - In certain cases when outputting characters at the end of the line, e.g.,
      when displaying the prompt string, readline positions the cursor
      incorrectly if the prompt string contains invisible characters and the
      text being drawn begins before the last invisible character in the line.
    - There is an off-by-one error in the code that buffers characters
      received very quickly in succession, causing characters to be dropped.
    - References made within a function to an uninitialized local array
      variable using the [*] subscript in a double-quoted string  can result
      in spurious ASCII 127 characters in the expanded value.
  * Remove bash-completion from the source.

      when jumping back to the top-level processing loop from
      a builtin command.
    - 021: When the parser read a backslash-escaped character that would
      be treated internally as an escape, it would double the number
      of escape characters.
    - 022: POSIX specifies that the `read' builtin invoked from an interative
      shell must prompt with $PS2 when a line is continued using a backslash
      while reading from a terminal.
    - 023: When an error occurs during the pattern removal word expansion,
      the shell can free unallocated memory or free memory multiple times.
    - 024: Fix calculation of screen position when performing a redisplay in
      which the new text uses more space, but fewer bytes.
    - 025: Fix dropping each 511th character of buffered input, e.g. when
      pasting a large amount of data.

  * Apply upstream patch 011 - 013, fixes for:
    - 011: Under certain circumstances (loopback mounts), the bash getcwd does
      not return correct results.  This patch allows the use of the Solaris
      libc getcwd even though it doesn't dynamically allocate memory.
    - 012: Some systems (AIX 4.x) don't implement the PRI_xxx macros correctly,
      causing syntax errors when attempting to compile bash on those systems.
      This patch adds support for the PRI_MACROS_BROKEN define.
    - 013: Readline neglects to reallocate the array it uses to keep track
      of wrapped screen lines when increasing its size.  This will eventually
      result in segmentation faults when given sufficiently long input.

bash (3.2-0ubuntu6) feisty; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch 010.
    The glibc implementation of regcomp/regexec does not allow backslashes to
    escape "ordinary" pattern characters when matching.  Bash used backslashes
    to quote all characters when the pattern argument to the [[ special
    command's =~ operator was quoted.  This caused the match to fail on Linux
    and other systems using GNU libc.

    printed.  Unfortunately the code is badly tangled making this small
    fix the most appropriate approach.)

bash (3.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed in bash-3.0:
    - New option pipefail. If set, the return value of a pipeline is the
      value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status,
      or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully.  This option
      is disabled by default. The two oldest outstanding bash reports are
      gone (closes: #7047, #10494).
    - "$( substitution strangeness (closes: #187983).
    - timestamp support in history (closes: #161057).

  * Apply patch to fix non POSIX function name and avoid use of global
    variables (Stephen Gildea). Closes: #262105.

    Closes: #243015.

bash (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Bugs fixed in this release (and the alpha/beta releases and release
    candidates):
    - Fixed a bug that caused the prompt to overwrite previous output when the
      output doesn't contain a newline and the locale supports multibyte
      characters.  This same change fixes the problem of readline redisplay
      slowing down dramatically as the line gets longer in multibyte locales.
      Closed: #179883.
    - The shell no longer seg faults if the expanded value of $PS4 is null
      and `set -x' is enabled. Closes: #165533.
    - Don't define a default DEFAULT_MAIL_DIRECTORY, because it can cause
      a timeout on NFS mounts. Closes: #211426.
    - Fixed a bad interaction between alias and completion. Closes: #186218.
    - Fix initialization of local variables with "$@". Closes: #180290.
    - Fixed segfault in "read -a foo <<< $(echo)". Closes: #167003.
    - Fixed the history word tokenizer to handle <( and >( better when used as
      part of bash. Closes: #165212.
    - Fixed EINTR signal killing redirection. Closes: #164134.
    - Fixed infinite loop with IFS="<non-ws-char>" and compgen -W.
      Closes: #162952.
    - Fixed the internal logout code so that shells that time out waiting for
      input (using $TMOUT) run ~/.bash_logout. Closes: #152847.
    - Speedups to the multibyte character redisplay code. Closes: #197965.
    - Better error message on wrong kill arguments. Closes: #193570.
    - Overwriting of prompt. Closes: #176968.
    - The shell now reports on processes that dump core due to signals when
      invoked as `-c command'. Closes: #211693.
    - Fixed ferror beeing called w/o always first calling clearerr
      results in spurious errors reported. Closes: #195116.
    - Add missing trailing slash on directory completion. Closes: #178828.
    - Fix different behaviour for builtin and external commands together
      with arithmetic expansion. Closes: #173744.
    - Fixed a bug that caused redirections accompanying a null command
      to persist in the current shell. Closes: #173148.
    - Fixed a bug that caused a leading `-' in the shell's name to cause it to
      not be recognized as a restricted shell. Closes: #170298.
    - Fix segfault in ill formed paramter expansion. Closes: #162773.
    - Fixed a bug in brace expansion that caused a quoted `$' preceding an
      open brace to inhibit brace expansion. Closes: #157954.
    - Removed the attempts to avoid adding a slash at the end of a completed
      executable name if there was a directory with the same name in the
      current directory. Closes: #155134, #189006.
    - Fix error message for circular alias expansions. Closes: #173588.
    - Fixed a bug that caused some key bindings set in an inputrc to be ignored
      at shell startup. Closes: #110969.
    - Fix segfault on bad array subscripts. Closes: #232653.
    - Fix "set completion-ignore-case on" breaking some tab completion.
      Closes: #224303.
    - Flag an error when a user uses "% DIGITS" instead of "%DIGITS", and
      don't give him a different job instead. Closes: #173854.
    - For 'cd filename' say 'not a directory', not 'no such file or directory'
      when filename exists and is not a directory. Closes: #219958.
    - Expansion results are the same for ${1:+"$@"} and "$@" if IFS is not
      the default.
    - The locale code does a better job of recomputing the various locale
      variable values when LC_ALL is unset. Closes: #160932.
    - Fix substitution error triggering an assertion. Closes: #251801.
  * Documentation updated in this release (and the alpha/beta releases):
    - Fix documentation about exit status of unset builtin. Closes: #183352.
    - Clarify documentation for arguments of wait builtin. Closes: #174133.

      expansion. Closes: #167002.
    - Documentation for values of various assignments updated. Closes: #168331.
    - In section "Shell Functions", add documentation for syntax,
      which bash accepts. Closes: #172971.
    - Fix documentation of the PATH variable. Closes: #155369.
    - Document SHELL variable in section "Shell Variables". Closes: #249657.
    - Remove reference to missing section in rbash(1). Closes: #249219.
  * Fix another segfault in completion code. Closes: #261142.

  * Remove changelog from bash package (also in bash-doc). Reported as
    #93446, #93454, #93455.

  * Documented behaviour (ulimit, #72898).
  * Use of redirection for #92324.
  * sed, awk, ... builtins should be provided by the specific package.
    there are other ways to make system scripts faster (ash, perl,

    as explanation for C-s behaviour (#68387, not sure why I missed this
    for so long).
  * Part one of the report is Posix.2 behaviour; part 2 (cd-ing relatively
    from a subdirectory into a specified root-level directory) already
    fixed in bash-2.04. #65316.
  * Closing #13645. "The `-l' option should never have been documented, and it
    was a mistake to include it in the first place -- it screws up the grammar.
    Old Bourne shells and test commands had it because there was no other
    way to find the length of a variable's value.  Since bash has
    ${#variable}, there's no need for it.  POSIX.2 says, in the rationale,
    that implementation is irregular and that the shell supports it directly
  * Unable to reproduce #19211 submitted for version 2.01 in current
    versions (2.04, 2.05).
  * Close #2301, safe creation of temp files is documented in bash(1):
    "If the redirection operator is >, and the noclobber option to the set
    builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose
    name results from the expansion of word exists and is a regular file.
    If the redirection operator is >|, or the redirection operator is > and
    the noclobber option to the set builtin command is not enabled, the
    redirection is attempted even if the file named by word exists."
  * Fixed upstream in 2.05: #84743.
  * #76596: Bourne-style shells have always accepted multiple directory name
    arguments to cd.  If the user doesn't like it, have him define a shell
    function (see README.Debian).
  * bash already has enabled the system wide /etc/bash.bashrc (#82117).
  * #88223: Starting bash with --posix, or -o posix, or as `sh', does make
    the entire bash session posix-compliant (with the caveats noted in the
    info manual).  Posix-compliant does not mean `behaves exactly like
    historical versions of sh', nor does it mean `does only what is in
    the standard and nothing more'.

    Posix says nothing about brace expansion, so whether or not bash does
    brace expansion in posix mode has no bearing on posix compliance.

    If you don't want brace expansion, use `set +o braceexpand' or
    `set +B' or start bash with the `+B' option.

  * Lower temporarily severity of #92455, so that this version can move
    to testing. This bug exists in 2.04 as well, so we don't make things
    worse.
  * Apply upstream patch 1.

  * Still in this version: #27090.
  * The `-l' option to test is not included by intent (fixes #13645).
    Comment from upstream: "The `-l' option should never have been documented,
    and it was a mistake to include it in the first place -- it screws up the
    grammar. Old Bourne shells and test commands had it because there was no
    other way to find the length of a variable's value.  Since bash has
    ${#variable}, there's no need for it.  POSIX.2 says, in the rationale,
    that implementation is irregular and that the shell supports it directly.
  * Report #26720: perl -e 'print ":;" x 100000' > foo; . ./foo   dumps core.
    Comment from upstream: This is not a bash bug; it is a process resource
    problem.  The default resource limit for stack size is 8M on my version of
    Linux. The call tree created by the parser for the script (100000 calls
    to `:') is 99999 nodes deep, and requires that many recursive calls to the
    command execution routines.  This overflows the stack, and bash segfaults.
    I couldn't reproduce it anywhere but Linux, because the machines I tested
    on all have reasonable default stack sizes.  Raising the limit to 16M is
    sufficient to cause the script to run successfully (I didn't try anything
    between 8M and 16M).
  * Report #30460: redirection is different from standard: bash --posix
    $ mkdir foo; cd foo; echo anything goes > "this file"
    $ for f in *; do tr ay \ o < $f | cat; done
    sh: $f: ambiguous redirect
    This is POSIX.2 behaviour.
  * debian/bash.preinst.c: Check if /bin/sh points to something other than
    bash and is not diverted and point to README.Debian how to divert

  * Fixed in 2.03 or before: #16013, #20455, #30803 (according to upstream
    author, bug submitter does not respond).
  * #44015 not a bug. Bash is more liberal than POSIX specifies, but function
    names that are not identifiers is something that may go away in the future.
  * #40242 not a bug: Non-interactive bash shells have always unset PS1,
    so scripts and so on can test for it.
  * Report #21645: */text* completion doesn't work anymore. According to the
    upstream author, this feature was removed in bash-2.01.1.  The TAB
    completion only succeeds with globbing characters if there is a single
    completion.  It caused too many problems otherwise.
  * Define DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE: We don't want to see `Broken pipe' messages
    when a job like `cat jobs.c | exit 1' is executed. Fixes part of #7047,
    #10259, #10433 and #10494. Comment from the upstream author: "The default
    bash behavior with respect to the exit status of a pipeline will not
    change.  Changing it as suggested in the discussion of #10494 would render
    bash incompatible with every other shell out there.". Closed these reports.

    description of new features and bug fixes see /usr/share/doc/bash/NEWS.gz.
  * Fixed in upstream release (closes: #14229, #16856, #21363, #22498, #28849,
    #29863, #37971, #38411, #40930, #49702). #37971 either here or in libc6.
    #30803.
  * Separate out documentation and examples to bash-doc package.
  * Do not build shared readline libs from this source. According to the
    upstream author: "It's not appropriate to build shared libraries from
    the readline shipped with bash.  That is designed to be linked directly
    into bash."
  * Link statically with included libreadline. It's intended, because
    potato does not have a libreadline4 yet. Wait for bash-2.04 and
    it's version of libreadline.
  * debian/README.Debian: Sort of FAQ suggested by Guy Maor.
  * debian/copyright: Updated URL.
  * debian/rules: Introduced some variables for packages and directories.
  * debian/control: Updated package names. Add Build-Depends.
  * Point to /usr/doc/share in man pages (rbash.1, builtins.1).

  * Compile with -DSYS_BASHRC defined. /etc/bash.bashrc is empty by default
    (closes #27055).
  * Fixed with boot-floppies 2.1.3 (closes: #22517).
  * debian/patches/mailcheck.dpatch: Add maildir support. Patch from
    Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> (closes #38794).
  * Patches from NMU are applied (should close #43096).
  * debian/control: Make builtins depend on source version of bash.
  * Build for i386, not i486.
  * Report #28811: "dpkg segfaults trying to install bash. Logging in then
    produces segfault. Still having to run 2.00.0(1)". Not reproducable.
  * Report #15165: "If the last command in the pipeline is killed by a signal,
    bash does not report it even though $? contains the correct value".
    Not reproducable.
  * Report #21645: "If you type `rm */text*<TAB>', previous versions would
    complete text given that they're under the same directory. 2.01.1-1
    doesn't do that anymore.". Not documented anywhere. It seems, this was
    a bug disguised as a feature ;-)
  * Report #36027: "During compiling bash package, files with hardcoded names
    are created in /tmp. In a malicious multi-user environment, this allows
    attacks to the user's files and possibly allow creating trojan packages.
    If the compiling user is root...".

  * Report #35979, #45379: set -e works on simple commands only.
    (command) is not a simple command.
  * Report #38244: -x and -v and all of the rest of the options are documented
    in the `set' builtin section.  The OPTIONS section of the man page refers

    grep is looking for `not' in file `a'.  Try `w | echo $(tty)'.
  * Report #33822: This is a locale problem.  The de_DE locale gives lower case
