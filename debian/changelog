    - debian/control: Breaks shim (<< 13).
    - debian/patches/linuxefi.patch: Secure Boot support: use newer patchset
      from rhboot repo, flattened to a single patch.
    - debian/patches/install_signed.patch, grub-install-extra-removable.patch:
      - Make sure if we install shim; it should also be exported as the default
        bootloader to install later to a removable path, if we do.
      - Rework grub-install-extra-removable.patch to reverse its logic: in the
        default case, install the bootloader to /EFI/BOOT, unless we're trying
        to install on a removable device, or explicitly telling grub *not* to
        do it.
      - Install a BOOT.CSV for fallback to use.
      - Make sure postinst and templates know about the replacement of
        --force-extra-removable with --no-extra-removable.
    - debian/patches/ubuntu-support-initrd-less-boot.patch: allow non-initrd
      boot config.
    - debian/patches/ubuntu-add-initrd-less-boot-fallback.patch: If a kernel
      fails to boot without initrd, we will fallback to trying to boot the
      kernel with an initrd.
    - debian/patches/ubuntu-mkconfig-leave-breadcrumbs.patch: make sure
      grub-mkconfig leaves a trace of what files were sourced to help generate
      the config we're building.
    - debian/patches/ubuntu-efi-console-set-text-mode-as-needed.patch: in EFI
      console, only set text-mode when we're actually going to need it.
    - debian/patches/ubuntu-zfs-enhance-support.patch: Better ZFS grub support.
    - Disable os-prober for ppc64el on the PowerNV platform, to reduce the
      number of entries/clutter from other OSes in Petitboot
    - debian/patches/ubuntu-shorter-version-info.patch: Only show the upstream
      version in menu and console, and hide the package one in a
      package_version variable.
    - Verify that the current and newer kernels are signed when grub is
      updated, to make sure people do not accidentally shutdown without a
      signed kernel.
    - debian/default/grub: replace GRUB_HIDDEN_* variables with the less
      confusing GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden.
    - debian/rules: shuffle files around for now to keep build artefacts
      for signing at the same location as they were expected by Launchpad.
    - debian/rules, debian/control: enable dh-systemd.
    - debian/grub-common.install.in: install the systemd unit that's part of
      initrd fallback handling, missed when the feature landed.
    - debian/build-efi-images: add http module to NET_MODULES.
  * debian/patches/linuxefi*.patch: Flatten linuxefi patches into one.
  * debian/patches: rename patches to use "-" as a separator rather than "_".
  * debian/patches: rename Ubuntu-specific patches and commits to add "ubuntu"
    so it's clearer which are new or changed when doing a merge.
  * debian/patches/ubuntu-fix-lzma-decompressor-objcopy.patch: fix FTBFS due
    to objcopy building an invalid binary padded with zeroes (LP: #1833234)
  * debian/patches/ubuntu-clear-invalid-initrd-spacing.patch: clear up invalid
    spacing for the initrd command when not using early initrds.
  * debian/patches/ubuntu-add-initrd-less-boot-fallback.patch: move the initrd
    boot success/failure service to start later at boot time. (LP: #1823391)
  * debian/patches/fix-lockdown.patch: Drop lockdown patch from Debian, which
    breaks with new linuxefi patchset.
  * debian/patches/ubuntu-temp-keep-auto-nvram.patch: Temporarily keep the
    --auto-nvram option we previously had as a supported option in grub-install
    (with no effect now), to avoid breaking upgrades. "auto-nvram" is default
    behavior now that we use libefivar instead of calling efibootmgr.

      --auto-nvram option to grub-install for auto-detecting NVRAM availability
      before attempting NVRAM updates.
    - debian/build-efi-images: provide a new grub EFI image which enforces that
      loaded kernels are signed for Secure Boot: build gsb$arch.efi; which is
      the same as grub$arch.efi minus the 'linux' module. Without fallback to
      'linux' for unsigned loading, this makes it effectively enforce having a

      'text' payload if it's not supported but present in gfxpayload, such as
      on EFI systems.
    - debian/patches/bufio_sensible_block_sizes.patch: Don't use arbitrary file
      fizes as block sizes in bufio: this avoids potentially seeking back in
      the files unnecessarily, which may require re-open files that cannot be
      seeked into, such as via TFTP.
    - debian/patches/ofnet-init-structs-in-bootpath-parser.patch: initialize
      structs in bootpath parser.
    - debian/rules: shuffle files around for now to keep build artefacts
      for signing at the same location as they were expected by Launchpad.

      leaves a trace of what files were sourced to help generate the config
      we're building.
    - debian/patches/linuxefi_truncate_overlong_reloc_section.patch: Windows
      7 bootloader has inconsistent headers; truncate to the smaller, correct
      size to fix chainloading Windows 7.
    - debian/patches/linuxefi_fix_relocate_coff.patch: fix typo in
      relocate_coff() causing issues with relocation of code in chainload.
    - debian/patches/add-initrd-less-boot-fallback.patch: add initrd-less
      capabilities. If a kernel fails to boot without initrd, we will fallback
      to trying to boot the kernel with an initrd. Patch by Chris Glass.
    - debian/patches/grub-reboot-warn.patch: Warn when "for the next

  [ Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre]
  * Merge against Debian unstable; remaining changes:
    - debian/control: Update Vcs fields for code location on Ubuntu.
    - debian/control: Breaks shim (<< 13).
    - Secure Boot support: use newer patchset from rhboot repo:
      - many linuxefi_* patches added and modified
      - dropped debian/patches/linuxefi_require_shim.patch
      - renamed: debian/patches/no_insmod_on_sb.patch ->
        debian/patches/linuxefi_no_insmod_on_sb.patch
    - debian/patches/install_signed.patch, grub-install-extra-removable.patch:
      - Make sure if we install shim; it should also be exported as the default
        bootloader to install later to a removable path, if we do.
      - Rework grub-install-extra-removable.patch to reverse its logic: in the
        default case, install the bootloader to /EFI/BOOT, unless we're trying
        to install on a removable device, or explicitly telling grub *not* to
        do it.
      - Move installing fb$arch.efi to --no-extra-removable; as we don't want
        fallback to be installed unless we're also installing to /EFI/BOOT.
        (LP: #1684341)
      - Install a BOOT.CSV for fallback to use.
      - Make sure postinst and templates know about the replacement of
        --force-extra-removable with --no-extra-removable.
    - debian/patches/add-an-auto-nvram-option-to-grub-install.patch: Add the
      --auto-nvram option to grub-install for auto-detecting NVRAM availability
      before attempting NVRAM updates.
    - debian/build-efi-images: provide a new grub EFI image which enforces that
      loaded kernels are signed for Secure Boot: build gsb$arch.efi; which is
      the same as grub$arch.efi minus the 'linux' module. Without fallback to
      'linux' for unsigned loading, this makes it effectively enforce having a
      signed kernel. (LP: #1401532)
    - Verify that the current and newer kernels are signed when grub is
      updated, to make sure people do not accidentally shutdown without a
      signed kernel.
    - debian/default/grub: replace GRUB_HIDDEN_* variables with the less
      confusing GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden. (LP: #1258597)
    - debian/patches/support_initrd-less_boot.patch: Added knobs to allow
      non-initrd boot config. (LP: #1640878)
    - Disable os-prober for ppc64el on the PowerNV platform, to reduce the
      number of entries/clutter from other OSes in Petitboot (LP: #1447500)
    - debian/patches/shorter_version_info.patch: Only show the upstream version
      in menu and console, and hide the package one in a package_version
      variable. (LP: #1723434)
    - debian/patches/skip_text_gfxpayload_where_not_supported.patch: Skip the
      'text' payload if it's not supported but present in gfxpayload, such as
      on EFI systems. (LP: #1711452)
    - debian/patches/bufio_sensible_block_sizes.patch: Don't use arbitrary file
      fizes as block sizes in bufio: this avoids potentially seeking back in
      the files unnecessarily, which may require re-open files that cannot be
      seeked into, such as via TFTP. (LP: #1743249)
    * util/grub-install.c: Drop extra handling for x.efi.signed files for mok
      and fallback binaries: shim now installs them without the .signed
      extension. (LP: #1708245)
    - debian/patches/dont-fail-efi-warnings.patch: handle linuxefi patches and
      the casting they do on some architectures: we don't want to fail build
      because of some of the warnings that can show up since we otherwise build
      with -Werror.
  * debian/rules: shuffle files around for now to keep putting build artefacts
    for signing at the same location as they were expected by Launchpad.

      configuration key for grub-mkconfig.  This controls hidden-timeout
      handling more simply than the previous arrangements, and pressing any

  * Ignore functional test failures for now as they are broken.
  * Move working directories around (build/<package> -> obj/<package>,
    build/stamps -> debian/stamps) so that "debian/rules build" still works
    after working directories have been created.
  * Drop "grub-mkrescue --diet" option; never merged upstream and only
    matters for floppies.  Please let me know if you were using this.
    Explicitly use -no-pad to build grub-rescue-floppy.img, which has an

  * Convert to source format 3.0 (quilt).  Developers, note that patches are
    stored applied in bzr; you may want to 'quilt pop -a' / 'quilt push -a'
    around merges.
  * Remove pointless debian/grub-mount-udeb.install.hurd-i386;
    grub-mount-udeb is not built on the Hurd.
  * Refactor debian/grub-common.install.hurd-i386 into .in files so that it

  * Restore grub-mkdevicemap for now.  While it's kind of a mess, requiring
    lots of OS-specific code to iterate over all possible devices, we use it
    in a number of scripts to discover devices and reimplementing those in
    terms of something else would be very complicated.
  * Add grub-efi-ia64-bin and grub-efi-ia64 packages.  These are currently

  * Build-depend on gcc-4.6-multilib on kfreebsd-i386 and hurd-i386 as well

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Set PACKAGE_VERSION and PACKAGE_STRING using configure arguments rather
    than sedding configure.ac in debian/rules (which sometimes has annoying
    interactions with quilt, etc.).
  * Update branch_embed-sectors.patch:
    - Detect sector used by HighPoint RAID controller (closes: #394868).
  * Add debian/README.source (from quilt).
  * Make debian/rules more explicit about when autogen.sh is run.  We need
    to be careful that all full builds run it, since we use GRUB extras.
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Handle filesystems loop-mounted on file images.
    - On Wubi, don't ask for an install device, but just update wubildr
      using the diverted grub-install.
    - Add grub-mount-udeb, containing just grub-mount.  This can be used by
      os-prober and other parts of d-i.
    - Artificially bump Replaces: grub-common versioning to account for
      grub-reboot/grub-set-default movement in Ubuntu.
  * Don't do a separate build pass for grub-common.  It will be identical to
    the build for the default platform for the CPU architecture anyway, so
    reuse that.
  * Build with GCC 4.5 on all architectures.
  * Update Lintian overrides for changes in Lintian 2.5.0~rc1.
  * Invert how files are split among binary packages: rather than code in
    debian/rules to remove files we don't want, add dh_install configuration
    to declare the files we do want.  This means a little more repetition
    for platform-specific programs, but it seems less confusing and easier
    to extend.
  * Drop versioned dependencies on base-files.  GPL-3 has been there for two
    Debian releases now, and the dependency was never upgrade-critical
    anyway.
  * Create grub2-common package containing files that are common among GRUB
    platform packages but that would break GRUB Legacy, or that are too
    confusing when coinstalled with GRUB Legacy (closes: #564167).
  * Drop conflict on an ancient (pre-lenny/hardy) version of desktop-base.
  * Move /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme to grub-common, to go with the other
    /etc/grub.d/* files.
  * Drop redundant Suggests: os-prober from several platform packages, as
    grub-common already Recommends: os-prober.
  * Create grub-<platform>-bin packages corresponding to all grub-<platform>
    packages (except for grub-emu).  These do not automatically install the
    boot loader or update grub.cfg, and they install their binaries to
    /usr/lib/grub/<cpu>-<platform>/; this means that they can be installed
    in parallel, making it easier to use them to build GRUB-based disk
    images (e.g. d-i).  The grub-<platform> packages now depend on these and
    include symlinks, so their behaviour will remain as before.
  * Make grub-emu depend on grub-common.
  * Make the documentation directory in most binary packages be a symlink to
    that in grub-common.
  * Drop lenny compatibility from grub2-common's dpkg/install-info
    dependency, since it produces a Lintian warning and using the current
    packaging on lenny is probably rather a stretch anyway.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * New Bazaar snapshot.  Too many changes to list in full, but some of the
    more user-visible ones are as follows:
    - GRUB script:
      + Function parameters, "break", "continue", "shift", "setparams",
        "return", and "!".
      + "export" command supports multiple variable names.
      + Multi-line quoted strings support.
      + Wildcard expansion.
    - sendkey support.
    - USB hotunplugging and USB serial support.
    - Rename CD-ROM to cd on BIOS.
    - Add new --boot-directory option to grub-install, grub-reboot, and
      grub-set-default; the old --root-directory option is still accepted
      but was often confusing.
    - Basic btrfs detection/UUID support (but no file reading yet).
    - bash-completion for utilities.
    - If a device is listed in device.map, always assume that it is
      BIOS-visible rather than using extra layers such as LVM or RAID.
    - Add grub-mknetdir script (closes: #550658).
    - Remove deprecated "root" command.
    - Handle RAID devices containing virtio components.
    - GRUB Legacy configuration file support (via grub-menulst2cfg).
    - Keyboard layout support (via grub-mklayout and grub-kbdcomp).
    - Check generated grub.cfg for syntax errors before saving.
    - Pause execution for at most ten seconds if any errors are displayed,
      so that the user has a chance to see them.
    - Support submenus.
    - Write embedding zone using Reed-Solomon, so that it's robust against
      being partially overwritten (closes: #550702, #591416, #593347).
    - GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_RECOVERY and GRUB_DISABLE_NETBSD_RECOVERY merged
      into a single GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY variable.
    - Fix loader memory allocation failure (closes: #551627).
    - Don't call savedefault on recovery entries (closes: #589325).
    - Support triple-indirect blocks on ext2 (closes: #543924).
    - Recognise DDF1 fake RAID (closes: #603354).

      setting color_normal to black/black.
    - Don't try the other alternatives when $GRUB_BACKGROUND is set; you can

  * Add instructions for using grub-rescue-usb.img (closes: #586463).
  * Remove /usr/lib/grub/mips-* from grub-common rather than the incorrect
    /usr/lib/grub/mipsel-*, so that it stops clashing with grub-yeeloong;
    add a versioned Replaces to grub-yeeloong just in case (closes:
    #586526).
  * Remove qemu-system build-dependency on hurd-i386, where it doesn't seem
    to exist.  Disable tests if qemu-system-i386 isn't available.
  * Mark "upgrade-from-grub-legacy" paragraph in
    grub-pc/chainload_from_menu.lst as untranslatable.
  * Update Homepage field (thanks, Sedat Dilek).
  * On Linux, if /boot/grub/device.map exists on upgrade to this version,
    regenerate it to use stable device names in /dev/disk/by-id/.  If it had
    more than one entry, then display a critical-priority debconf note
    (sorry, but it's better than silently breaking boot menu entries)
    advising people to check custom boot menu entries and update them if
    necessary (closes: #583271).
  * Use 'set -e' rather than '#! /bin/sh -e' or '#! /bin/bash -e', to avoid
    accidents when debugging with 'sh -x'.
  * Store grub-pc/install_devices as persistent device names under
    /dev/disk/by-id/ (closes: #554790).  Migrate previous device names to
    that, with explicit confirmation in non-trivial cases to make sure we
    got the right ones.  If the devices we were told to install to ever go
    away, ask again.  (This is based on the implementation in Ubuntu.)
  * If grub-install fails during upgrade-from-grub-legacy, allow the user to
    try again with a different device, but failing that cancel the upgrade
    (closes: #587790).
  * Remove numbering from patch files.  The order is now explicit in a quilt
    series file, and renumbering from time to time is tedious.

grub2 (1.98+20100617-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Bazaar snapshot.
    - Fix i386-pc prefix handling with nested partitions (closes: #585068).

  * When running grub-pc.postinst from upgrade-from-grub-legacy, tell it to
    disregard the fact that /boot/grub/stage2 and /boot/grub/menu.lst still
    exist (closes: #550477).
  * Touch a marker file when grub-install is run but GRUB Legacy files are
    still around.  If that marker file is present, pretend that GRUB Legacy
    files are missing when upgrading.
  * If GRUB Legacy files are present when upgrading, scan boot sectors of
    all disks for GRUB 2.  If we find GRUB 2 installed anywhere, then ask
    the user if they want to finish conversion to GRUB 2, and warn them that
    not doing so may render the system unbootable (closes: #586143).  Thanks
    to Sedat Dilek for helping to narrow down this bug.
  * Leaving grub-pc/install_devices empty makes sense in some situations,
    but more often than not is a mistake.  On the other hand, automatically
    selecting all disk devices would upset some people too.  Compromise by
    simply asking for explicit confirmation if grub-pc/install_devices is
    left empty, defaulting to false so that simply selecting all the
    defaults in debconf can't leave you with an unbootable system (closes:

      configuration file generation using grub-mkconfig which documents the
      available keys in /etc/default/grub (closes: #497085).
    - Many USB fixes.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Reorganise configure and build targets in debian/rules to use stamp
    files.  configure/* never existed and build/* was always a directory, so
    make never considered either of them up to date (closes: #450505).
  * Remove config.h.in from AUTOGEN_FILES, since autoheader doesn't
    necessarily update it.
  * Remove conf/gcry.mk from AUTOGEN_FILES, and conf/gcry.rmk from their
    dependencies.  autogen.sh runs util/import_gcry.py after autoconf et al,
    so conf/gcry.rmk's timestamp will be later than some of the
    autogenerated outputs.
  * Go back to shipping rescue images in the grub-rescue-pc .deb itself
    rather than generating them in the postinst.  This means that (a) they
    get removed when the package is removed (closes: #584176); (b) they are
    listed in package metadata, as is proper for files in /usr (closes:
    #584218); (c) grub-rescue-pc can potentially be used as a
    build-dependency for other packages that need to build GRUB images into
    installation media etc., without having to build-depend on grub-pc which
    isn't coinstallable with other platform variants and does invasive
    things in its postinst.
  * Add grub-mkrescue patch from Thomas Schmitt to allow reducing the size
    of xorriso-created images.  Use this to ensure that
    grub-rescue-floppy.img fits well within size limits (closes: #548320).

  * Change the bt-utf-source build dependency to xfonts-unifont. It's
    more complete, better maintained and grub-mkfont supports actually
    more then BDF fonts as input, thanks to libfreetype.
  * Use grub-probe to get the GRUB device of /boot/grub instead of
    passing (hd0) to grub-install when creating the core.img with
    chainloading. This avoids the (UUID=) hack slowness in case
    /boot/grub is on a different disk then (hd0) in device.map.
  * patches/903_grub_legacy_0_based_partitions.diff: Update.
  * Add a build dependency on automake and python.
  * Set TARGET_CC=$(CC) to really use gcc-4.4 everywhere. Also pass it
    and CC as arguments to ./configure instead of env vars so they get

    make it work for grub2.

    to be an endless source of problems (and forbidden by policy as well).
