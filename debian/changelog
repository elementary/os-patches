network-manager-applet (1.0.10-1ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=low

  [ Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Merge from Debian unstable.  Remaining changes:

      notification messages for disconnect events, to be in line with the other
      *connect*text patches.
    - lp460144_correctly_update_notification.patch: cleaner notification
      messages, and allow for messages to be updated instead of cleared.
    - applet-wifi-menu-before-vpn.patch: show Create New and Connect to Hidden
      wifi menu items with the other Wifi items, rather than separated by
      the VPN menus.
    - nm-applet-use-indicator.patch: patch to support showing nm-applet as an
      appindicator in Unity.
    - position_dialogs_to_center_of_the_screen.patch: position dialogs to the
      center of the screen.
    - make_menu_items_insensitive_based_on_permissions.patch,
      hide_policy_items_env_var.patch: provide a method to desensitize or hide
      menu items which are useless given the current policykit policy level of
      the user.
    - applet_adhoc_use_wpa_rsn_part1.patch: enable Ad-Hoc using WPA RSN.
    - lp1048516_dont_req_keyring_in_greeter.patch: don't try to load the
      keyring if the user has no permissions to edit their own connections.
    - lp1048520_delay_pin_dialog_in_greeter.patch: only ask for PIN entry when
      a connection is being established rather than when a modem is detected.
    - rebuild_menu_after_init.patch: force a rebuild of the menu to avoid it
      staying empty on login.
    - ubuntu_dont_autostart_under_GNOME.patch
    - hide_virtual_devices.patch: updated to no longer show
    - debian/rules: ship extra icons, use --enable-indicators, export
      translations for Launchpad and fail if any files are missing from
      .install files, or not being installed.
    - debian/control: Build-Depend on dh-translations, libappindicator3-dev,
      update package descriptions, add Breaks against gnome-bluetooth (<< 3.0),
      switch gnome-icon-theme to adwaita-icon-theme, don't build the migration
      helper

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Drop ubuntu_dont_autostart_under_GNOME.patch. The latest release has
    GNOME in NotShowIn list, so that patch does not make any sense.

network-manager-applet (0.9.10.1-0ubuntu2) vivid; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches/nm-applet-use-indicator.patch: initialize GSList dupes var
    to NULL. Thanks to Patrik Fimml for the patch. (LP: #1046210)
  * debian/patches/rebuild_menu_after_init.patch: use a g_idle_add rather than
    a 30 second timeout, so as to make sure the menu update can't run until
    foo_set_initial_state did. (LP: #1418260)
  * debian/patches/hide_virtual_devices.patch: don't show bridge, bond, team,
    or vlan devices: they were only recently added to NM and nm-applet, and
    given that they are usually not managed, showing them tends to be
    confusing since they are usually the result of underlying software which
    might not expect their state to get changed by NM. (LP: #1423819)

network-manager-applet (0.9.10.1-0ubuntu1) vivid; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release: 0.9.10.1.
  * Resync packaging with Debian:
    - debian/rules: Set DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH, use dh_install exclusions rather
      than removing .la and .a files separately. 
    - debian/control: Build-depends: update NM b-deps, 
      bump to dh 9, update libgtk/libglib2.0 b-deps versions and make
      libnm-gtk Multi-Arch-aware.
    - debian/*.install: update paths for multi-arch.
    - debian/compat: bump to compat level 9.
  * debian/patches dropped because they were applied upstream:
    - git_use_paths_in_vpn_name_files_4867951.patch,
    - git_revert_system_ca_cert.patch,
    - lp289466_always_show_tray_icon.patch,

    debian/patches/lp330571_dxteam_wired_connect_text.patch,
    debian/patches/lp330608_dxteam_gsm_connect_text.patch: stop carrying
    needless string changes causing delta with upstream; any changes to the
    strings should happen there so we stay in sync.
    dropped; included upstream.
  * Refreshed remaining patches.

  * Use the paths specified in the VPN .name files.
    Since LIBDIR of nm-applet and the VPN plugins aren't necessarily the
    same, use the paths as specified by the VPN plugins and only
    reconstruct the path if it is not absolute or we fail to load the plugin.

  * New upstream release 0.8.4.
  * debian/source/format: migrate to debian source format 3.0 (quilt).
  * debian/control: sync with Debian's changes:
    - drop a bunch of old, unnecessary build dependencies.
    - keep in Build-Depends: libiw-dev, libxml-parser-perl, libnss3-dev,
      libappindicator-dev
    - add to Build-Depends: dh-autoreconf and libnm-glib-vpn-dev.
    - network-manager-gnome: specify package's Section as gnome.
    - network-manager-gnome: add policykt-1-gnome, gnome-icon-theme, dbus-x11
      to Depends.

    - use dh-autoreconf to reconfigure the build tree.
    - drop old dapper-to-intrepid and karmic-to-lucid workarounds for icon
      changes.
    - we switch to using png icons directly instead of uuencoded png files; so
      remove the uudecode parts that are no longer necessary.
    - don't empty aclocal.m4.
    - do some extra cleanup of files left behind by the build process.
    - drop configure parameters --with-mbca, --with-nss, --without-gnutls.
  * debian/icons/22/*: replace uuencoded png icons by their original, decoded
    versions.

    file for network-manager-gnome, minus the part about using the netdev user.

    - Rename network-manager-applet.manpages to network-manager-gnome.manpages.

    debian/patches/lp268803_xdg_autostart_gnome_xfce_only.patch,
    debian/patches/lp295788_xfce_menu_entry.patch:
    Install the 04-autostart.patch patch, editing the .desktop files from
    Debian and adjust it to also replace OnlyShowIn with NotShowIn=KDE for
    nm-connection-editor. This renders the two other patches obsolete, so
    drop them. Also fixes (LP: #753300).
