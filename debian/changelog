  * d/p/0003-Use-ValueError-instead-of-ImportError-to-catch-excep.patch: Fix
    exception handling when importing libsecret, that should made it really
    optional (Closes: #868039)

    debian/local/udev-configure-printer@.service: Use UDEV rules and
    systemd service files from upstream.
  * debian/patches/33_ipp-over-usb-support.patch: Updated patch for the
    fact that CUPS and cups-browsed auto-discover IPP-over-USB printers,
    so we only need to start ippusbxd, but not create a queue. In case
    of HP printers supported by HPLIP we prefer HPLIP instead of
    IPP-over-USB to make scanning on MFPs work.

      + Have system-config-printer-udev recommend ippusbxd
      + Let system-config-printer-gnome be a transitional package.
    - debian/local/70-printers.rules,
      debian/local/udev-configure-printer@.service:
      + Let systemd do the UDEV-triggered call of udev-configure-printer in a
        way so that systemd does not kill ippusbxd after some minutes.
    - debian/local/source_system-config-printer.py:
      + Apport hook
    - debian/patches/0010-no-start-printer-applet-gnome.patch

    - debian/patches/40_do-not-show-media-col-option.patch:
      + Suppress the display of the "media-col" attribute since this is not a
        user-configurable option
    - debian/patches/43_options-py-use-debugprint.patch, 45_ppds-py-use-debugprint.patch:
      + Silence console output

      + Fixed connection type list for detected/discovered printers on the

        way to set up the printer.
    - debian/patches/60_prioritize-ipp-in-connections-list.patch:
      + As IPP is the most modern and sophisticated network printing protocol

        in the list of possible connections for a discovered network printer.
        Only HPLIP stays more highly prioritized as for HP multi-function
        devices as HPLIP print queue is required for the scanner to work.
    - debian/patches/63_do-not-use-driverless-ppd-on-non-ipp-connection.patch:
      + Make sure that auto-generated PPD files for driverless printing are

        In driverless printing options are sent to the printers as IPP
        attributes.
    - debian/patches/65_prefer-driverless-ppds.patch:
      + Prioritize auto-generated PPD files for driverless printing, as
        they poll the properties from the printer, they represent the
        printer best.
    - debian/patches/67_display-correct-icons.patch:
      + Fixed display of printer icons in the main window, now the icons
        correctly represent local printers and network prrinters.

system-config-printer (1.5.7+20160812-0ubuntu6) zesty; urgency=medium

  * Fixed IPP-over-USB printer support. IPP-over-USB is designed for
    driverless use of USB printers by giving the possibility to query
    all information needed to print on the printer (auto-generaste a
    PPD file) from the printer via IPP. Therefore we actually generate
    a PPD file based on IPP query. This also adds support for all
    USB-connected IPP Everywhere and Apple AirPrint printer if we do
    not have a specific PPD file or driver for them.
  * Let the binary package system-config-printer-udev recommend ippusbxd
    (1.23-1ubuntu1 or newer) and cups-filters-core-drivers (for the
    "driverless" utility, 1.13.4 or newer).

system-config-printer (0.7.69-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version
  * debian/watch: Use git-import-orig instead of uupdate so it integrates
    better with our git repository.
  * debian/rules: Drop the code to fix the executable permissions on
    /usr/share since it's being done properly on upstream tarball.
