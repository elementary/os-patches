  * BamfView: use statically allocated pspec to notify property changes
    BamfFactory: some initial cleanup, remove views that have changed
    their path and use cached children.
  * BamfView: use incremental children caching, delete them only when
    daemon stops Each view used to cleanup the cached children every
    time a new one was added or removed. This was needed at the dbus-
    glib times to handle the case of bamfdaemon restart, but now we can
    handle this nicely, clening the children up only when this happens.
  * BamfView: disconnect proper callback if a bamf-tab is closed I guess
    it was a typo, we need to disconnect to the callback we've been
    connected to before.
  * BamfView: don't try to reload the children if they're empty but we
    already tried once This finally mutes the "Unable to fetch children"
    warning... \o/. (LP: #943083)
  * Bamf: use generic marshallers when creating signals, remove legacy
    bamf-marshal Improvements to the build system, fixed "make
    distcheck" (it was still referencing the old bamf.h file) and
    generation of files when using parallel builds (make -jX).
  * BamfMatcher: If a Window has changed its class, then we try to
    rematch it This is mostly the case of LibreOffice, but if a window
    has changed its class, then we should try to re-match, checking if
    now it can be matched by a new application. If this is the case,
    then we remove the window from the previous application (that may
    eventually be closed) and we add it to the new one. Thanks to this
    we can finally remove a lot of libreoffice-only related code.
