Template: grub2/no_efi_extra_removable
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Skip extra installation to the EFI removable media path?
 Some EFI-based systems are buggy and do not handle new bootloaders correctly.
 If you do not make an extra installation of GRUB to the EFI removable media
 path, this may prevent your system from booting Debian correctly in case it is
 affected by this problem. However, it may remove the ability to boot any other
 operating systems that also depend on this path. If so, you will need to make
 sure that GRUB is configured successfully to be able to boot any other OS
 installations correctly.

Template: grub2/update_nvram
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Update NVRAM variables to automatically boot into Debian?
 GRUB can configure your platform's NVRAM variables so that it boots into
 Debian automatically when powered on. However, you may prefer to disable
 this behavior and avoid changes to your boot configuration. For example,
 if your NVRAM variables have been set up such that your system contacts a
 PXE server on every boot, this would preserve that behavior.

_Description: GRUB EFI system partitions:
 The grub-efi package is being upgraded. This menu allows you to select which
 EFI system partions you'd like grub-install to be automatically run for, if any.

 Running grub-install automatically is recommended in most situations, to
 prevent the installed GRUB core image from getting out of sync with GRUB
 modules or grub.cfg.

_Description: GRUB install devices:
 The GRUB boot loader was previously installed to a disk that is no longer
 present, or whose unique identifier has changed for some reason. It is
 important to make sure that the installed GRUB core image stays in sync
 with GRUB modules and grub.cfg. Please check again to make sure that GRUB
 is written to the appropriate boot devices.

Type: boolean
Default: false
#flag:translate!:3
_Description: Writing GRUB to boot device failed - continue?
 GRUB failed to install to the following devices:
 .
 ${FAILED_DEVICES}
 .
 Do you want to continue anyway? If you do, your computer may not start up
 properly.

Template: grub-efi/install_devices_empty
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Continue without installing GRUB?
 You chose not to install GRUB to any devices. If you continue, the boot
 loader may not be properly configured, and when this computer next starts
 up it will use whatever was previously configured. If there is an
 earlier version of GRUB 2 in the EFI system partition, it may be unable to load
 modules or handle the current configuration file.
 .
 If you are already using a different boot loader and want to carry on
 doing so, or if this is a special environment where you do not need a boot
 loader, then you should continue anyway. Otherwise, you should install
 GRUB somewhere.

 Your system has UEFI Secure Boot enabled in firmware, and the following kernels
 present on your system are unsigned:

 These kernels cannot be verified under Secure Boot.  To ensure your system
 remains bootable, GRUB will not be upgraded on your disk until these kernels are
 removed or replaced with signed kernels.
