How to test the images with qemu:

  qemu -fda /usr/lib/grub-rescue/grub-rescue-floppy.img

  qemu -cdrom /usr/lib/grub-rescue/grub-rescue-cdrom.iso

  qemu -hda /usr/lib/grub-rescue/grub-rescue-usb.img

How to write the images to bootable media:

  sudo dd if=/usr/lib/grub-rescue/grub-rescue-floppy.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=32k

  sudo wodim /usr/lib/grub-rescue/grub-rescue-cdrom.iso
  # or just use your favourite CD burning program

  sudo dd if=/usr/lib/grub-rescue/grub-rescue-usb.img of=DEVICE bs=32k
  # where DEVICE is something like /dev/sdb, corresponding to your USB
  # stick's device name; be VERY CAREFUL that this is the correct device as
  # otherwise you could destroy data on your hard disk!
