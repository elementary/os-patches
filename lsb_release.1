.SH NOTES
This is a reimplementation of the 
.B lsb_release
command provided by the Free Standards Group.  Any bugs are solely the
responsibility of the author below.

Detection of systems using a mix of packages from various distributions
or releases is something of a black art; the current heuristic tends
to assume that the installation is of the earliest distribution which
is still being used by
.B apt
but that heuristic is subject to error.
