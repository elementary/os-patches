Cleaning ClutterText

  * Removing superfluous g_return_if_fail
  * Removing unused ClutterText::text-changed callback

2010-07-05 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Refactoring "window:create" and "window:destroy" emission code

Previously "window:create" and "window:destroy" were emitted on
CallyUtil. Although it works, and CallyUtil already have callbacks to
stage_added/removed signals, I think that it is more tidy/clear to do
that on CallyRoot:

  * CallyRoot already has code to manage ClutterStage addition/removal

  * In fact, we can see CallyRoot as the object exposing the a11y
    information from ClutterStageManager, so it fits better here.

  * CallyUtil callbacks these signals are related to key event
    listeners (key snooper simulation). One of the main CallyUtil
    responsabilities is managing event (connecting, emitting), so I
    would prefer to not start to add/mix more functionalities here.

Ideally it would be better to emit all CallyStage methods from
CallyStage, but it is clear that "create" and "destroy" are more easy
to emit from a external object.

2010-06-25 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Cleaning clutter-actor

Some cleaning changes:
  * Using CallyActionFunc instead of ACTION_FUNC
  * Removing a extra * on cally-actor-private macro documentation, to
    avoid gtk-doc warnings
  * Using g_strcmp0 instead of strcmp

Changes to be applied on clutter (see CB#2097 and CB#2098), applied
also here to maintain the sync. My intention is keep this developing line
until the real integration, in order to make a final independent cally
release.

Adding -Wshadow option and solving warnings related


2010-06-14 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Added dummy padding for future vt expasion

Added dummy padding on the different classes structures, to allow
future expansion of virtual methods.

I decided to add this on all the classes, although it would be
really unlikely in some cases (ie, CallyGroup)

2010-06-10 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Adding and emitting "window:xxx" methods on CallyStage

Added some window related signals on CallyStage:

  * window:activate and window:deactivate emitted from CallyStage
  * window:create and window:destroy emitted from CallyUtil

ClutterStage doesn't fulfill 100% the window concept, but some of
these signals are important in order to identify the object which
could emit global/key events.

The current implementation is equivalent to GailWindow one, supposing
CallyStage as the only window related window. This likely would change
in any clutter-based toolkit implement a real Window object, so a more
flexible procedure would be required. But we would solve problems step
by step.

BTW: as I explain here [1] I really think that the current way to
implement "window:xxx" signals (not defined in ATK but expected from
the a11y implementation toolkit) somewhat hacky and undocumented (you
need to check at-spi2 idls to know that you require to emit this
events)

Related to bug CB#2147 (Orca doesn't speech out properly non
printable chars on some environments), as solves this problem
in a specific case.

Avoiding clutter_stage_get_key_focus warning

For any reason, in some cases, a clutter actor doesn't have a stage
associated. We use the default one as fallback.

2010-06-02 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Added a defunct check on cally_group_get_n_children

Update TODO file

Use Bugzilla to setting missing features.

2010-06-01 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Removing heuristics to decide CallyRectable/CallyTexture role

Previously CallyRectangle and CallyTexture used some heuristics in
order to decide the default role: ATK_ROLE_IMAGE or
ATK_PUSH_BUTTON, as in practice most applications using these
objects as buttons were not applying the proper role.

As this is a hack, and a application responsibility, finally we
have decided to remove this, so the default role is ATK_ROLE_IMAGE.

Fixes CB#1732 (CallyTexture and CallyRectangle uses some heuristics to
decide the role)

2010-05-28 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Post-release version bump, after release 1.2.0

I wrongly added the last commit on the 1.1 branch, when in fact it
requires clutter 1.3.3, and on the README it is explained that
cally versioning is tied to clutter versioning. In order to solve
that a clutter-1.2 release branch is created, and bumped the version.

This versioning tyding will be obsolete when the integration with
clutter become a reality, but in the same way, this is the way to
tidy this thinking in this integration.

2010-04-13 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Use clutter_actor_get_accessible

The method clutter_actor_get_accessible was added due work on
bug 2070, and should be used to get the accessibility object,
instead of atk_gobject_accessible_for_object

This would allow to implement a11y support directly on
any clutter based toolkit object (ie StLabel).

2010-05-13 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Added CallyClone example


2010-05-13 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Remove gail dependency

Removed to avoid gdk/gtk dependency on cally.

Part of bug CB#2072 solution

2010-04-14 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Avoid gdk functions filling AtkKeyEventStruct

Now when AtkKeyEventStruct is filled in order to emit any key event
signal, it is not used any gdk function on the keyval or the
string fields.

event_string is filled with the printable character if possible, if
not (Ctrl, Alt, etc) it is set as NULL.

Now the AT should take care of that, at least until we define atk key
event struct in a more agnostic way (not tied to gdk/gtk). See orca
bug bgo#616206 as a example.

Part of bug CB#2072 solution.

2010-04-15 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Part of bug CB#2072 solution

2010-04-14 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Remove gailutil/gailmisc functions calls

This is because gailutil/gailmisc added a gdk/gtk dependency, and
this dependency is being removed. New cally-specific implementation
are required.

2010-02-25 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Change "--with-dbus" option for "atk-bridge-dir" on examples

The atk-adaptor in the dbus at-spi was renamed to atk-bridge due
some apps hardcoding the name. So right now the only difference
is the final directory.

So the option was removed, and atk-bridge-dir added. This also allows
to use the system atk-bridge or the compiled in any developing environment,
so it is really more flexible.

See the README (updated with this commit) for more information.

Release 1.1.1


2010-02-19 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Using clutter_threads_idle_add instead of the gdk one

The idea is being as less gdk dependent as possible. Right now
it is inviable to remove the dependency (gailutil and so on) but
hypothetically, the ideal is remove this dependency in the future,
and being "clutter pure".

Check if the state is defunct on cally_text_get_name

Update on configure.ac after autoupdate call


2010-02-02 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Try to apply the key modifiers to event->keyval like GDK does

ClutterKeyEvent defines the keyval without taking into account the
modifiers. GDK defines this keyval taking into account the modifiers.

AtkKeyEventStruct expects the keyval in a GDK fashion, so a
translation is required.

This patch tries to do that using using
gdk_keymap_translate_keyboard_state.

This functions only works correctly if gtk has been initialized, so
the fallback is create the AtkKeyEventStruct with the keyval
provided by Clutter.

2010-02-02 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Filling AtkKeyEventStruct->string used on the atk key event listeners

Finally we use directly gdk_keyval_name. Not the ideal solution, but works,
and more important, it avoids to reimplement this issue on clutter or cally.

Fix clutter version required on the pc files


2010-01-22 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Check on configure time if any x11 clutter backend is in use

It uses AC_CHECK_LIB in order to check if x11 backend is in use.
It also modifies cally-actor in order to use the information
retrieved.

So now cally has a minimum multi-backend support. It only manages
a x11 (glx or eglx) backend, but at least, it checks it, so you
can compile cally without this backend. It probably will not work
properly, but at least you can compile and execute it.

Fix the perspective problems computing the on-screen extensions

Use clutter_actor_get_abs_allocation_vertices and
clutter_actor_get_transformed_size to get the real on-screen
position and size, instead of compute that using the geometry
and the anchor point.

It also update cally-atkcomponent-example, adding a actor inside
a nested ClutterGroup hierarchy.

Added ATK_STATE_SELECTABLE_TEXT management


2009-11-26 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Manage properly ATK_STATE_ACTIVE on CallyStage

* cally/cally-stage.c
Added private struct
(cally_stage_class_init),(cally_stage_init),(cally_stage_real_initalize):
Initialization stuff
(cally_stage_activate_cb)
(cally_stage_deactivate_cb): new ClutterStage signal callbacks, change
the internal value of active, and notify the atk state change
(cally_stage_ref_state_set): manage ATK_STATE_ACTIVATE
* examples/cally-atktext-example2.c
If possible, creates two stage, in order to test ATK_STATE_ACTIVATE

2009-11-24 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Focused state change and focused object notification

* cally/cally-actor.h
(focus_clutter): added virtual method for the focus management
* cally/cally-actor.c
(cally_actor_component_interface_init)
(cally_actor_add_focus_handler)
(cally_actor_remove_focus_handler):
Implementation of the AtkComponent methods add_focus_handler and
remove_focus_handler
(cally_actor_focus_event): CallyActor specific focus handler, notify
the state focused change
(cally_actor_focus_clutter)
(cally_actor_real_focus_clutter):
Handlers for the ClutterActor "key-focus-in" and "key-focus-out"
signals. Emit the signal AtkObject "focus_event" and set the focus
object with atk_focus_tracker_notify.
(cally_actor_initialize):
Connect to the signals "key-focus-in" and "key-focus-out", use
atk_component_add_focus_handler to add cally_actor_focus_event

Note: The focus management is more simplified that the gail one. The
main reason is that the focus management in GTK is really more complex
that the Clutter one.

Modify cally-atkeditabletext-example.c to manage "activatable" status


2009-11-24 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Added "activate" action in ClutterText

* cally/cally-actor.h
* cally/cally-actor.c
cally_actor_add_action now returns the action id added. Documentation
added in order to explain the return values and others.

* cally/cally-text.c
Added action "activate". This action is only available if the ClutterText is
activatable, so the "activatable" property is tracked in the notify

2009-11-20 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Signal event emission

Emits the signals "text_selection_changed", "text_caret_moved",
"text_changed::insert", "text_changed::delete", and notify the
ATK_STATE_EDITABLE state change.

It also adds the ATK_STATE_EDITABLE in the ref_state_set, includes a
finalize to clean the new private data used, and move part of the
initialization from the _init to the _real_initialization.

2009-12-03 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Remove the ATK_STATE_DEFUNCT emission

Remove the ATK_STATE_DEFUNCT emission, as this is already made by
AtkGObjectAccessible.

It also removes the clutter actor from the private structure, as we
can use the AtkGObjectAccessible API to obtain it. This makes the code
more coherent, with respect of the rest of the Cally classes
implementation.

Support for multiple stages

* cally-root.c
* cally-stage.c
* cally-util.c
Implemented the support for multiple stages, by tracking the signals
stage-added and stage-removed of the ClutterStageManager.

In the same way CallyRoot has implement properly the atk_object_initialize,
and in general now is more tied to ClutterStageManager (CallyRoot is now
the a11y object of ClutterStageManager), but factory not required anyway,
as it is instanced on the CallyUtil atk_get_root

Add --with-dbus option executing the examples

The replacement for atk-bridge on at-spi-dbus has a different name
(atk-adaptor), and it has not defined the method gnome_accessibility_init.
The --with-dbus option allow to load the correct library and use the
correct hook method if you are using at-spi-dbus.

environment, this should be made in a more general way.

* configure.ac:
  Change API_VERSION_MAJOR for CALLY_API_VERSION, as was the real
  meaning, and define CALLY_VERSION.
  Change CALLY_OBJ_CFLAGS and CALLY_OBJ_LIBS, used to compile the
  tests, as was not required to compile against the cally module (the
  example only required to compile against Clutter, as the cally
  module was just a module loaded by GModule).
  Support for Shave.

2009-07-31 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Be able to run the examples without installing Cally

Before that, the examples searched the cally module from the final installed
directory. This means that you should install the library to use the examples.
On development this is not desirable. Now it is loaded from ../cally/.libs

This is a little hackish, but more useful, and in the end, it is just a example.
Probably a best option could be configure that on the command line.
   $ ./example --cally-dir="mydir"

But just a nitpick.

Fixed return value of cally_actor_get_index_in_parent

Bug and solutiond pointed by Gerd Kohlberger

2009-06-30 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Added the implementation of most AtkText methods for CluttetText (CallyText)

It remains some methods:
  get_default_attributes
  get_character_extents
  get_offset_at_point

The current gail implementation delegate on gailmisc, but this is tied to
GtkWidget so an equivalent functionality would be implemented (something like
callymisc), and in the case of get_character_extents, not sure about the layout
position (see gtk_entry_get_layout_offsets).

I think that worth manage this in a different commit.

In the same way is still missing AtkEditableText support.

2009-07-07 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

Added CALLY_GET_CLUTTER_ACTOR macro

This macro was created to simplify how do you get the clutter actor object
related to the cally object. On CallyActor a private attributte maintains it
(for convenience, as it is heavily used) but outside, atkgobject methods can
be used. Note that there is a possibility on the future to change it. Two
options:
  * Add a public method to get the clutter object
  * Use this method on CallyActor too

This macro simplifies this:

CLUTTER_ACTOR (atk_gobject_accessible_get_object (ATK_GOBJECT_ACCESSIBLE (cally_object)))

By default the examples are not compiled, use "--enable-examples" on configure
time in order to enable their compilation.

This basic example basically shows several objects, with different depth, in
order to check that AtkComponent returns the correct screen position.

Missing cail-rectangle.[ch] files, according 2009-02-23 entry at Changelog


2009-02-23 Alejandro Piñeiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

2009-02-23 Alejandro Pinheiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

	* cail/cail-rectangle.[ch]
	* cail/cail.[ch]
	* cail/Makefile.am

	Added CailRectangle, a11y object for ClutterRectangle

	* cail/cail-group.c
	* cail/cail-texture.c
	* cail/cail-stage.c

	Avoid to add a empty private structure, to avoid the glib warning. Anyway
	the pointer to the private structure is still on the .h, to allow future
	add-on.

2009-02-20 Alejandro Pinheiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

	* cail-actor.[ch]
	* cail-group.[ch]

	Moved most of the ClutterContainer a11y support from cail-group to
	cail-actor, in order to generalize this support.

	* cail-stage.[ch]
	* cail-util.[ch]
	Normalize the private structure to avoid future problems with missing
	gaps

2009-02-20 Alejandro Pinheiro <apinheiro@igalia.com>

	* cail/cail-actor.c
	(cail_actor_connect_actor_destroyed): connects to the clutter actor
	destroy signal
	(cail_actor_clutter_actor_destroyed): handler to the clutter actor
	destroy signal, update the priv->actor pointer and notify a state change

	This change allows to be sure about the priv->actor correct value, so we
	can use directly priv->actor instead of atk_gobject_accessible_get_object
	in the next functions:
	(cail_actor_get_parent)
	(cail_actor_get_index_in_parent)
	(cail_actor_ref_state_set)
	(cail_actor_get_extents)

	* cail/cail-actor.c:
	(cail_actor_get_parent)
	Return the accessible object of the clutter actor if accessible_parent
	is not available. Previously it only took into account the these object
	as a possible parent to return (you can set it with atk_object_set_parent)
