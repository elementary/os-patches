/**
 * SECTION:cally-clone
 * @Title: CallyClone
 * @short_description: Implementation of the ATK interfaces for a #ClutterClone
 * @see_also: #ClutterClone
 *
 * #CallyClone implements the required ATK interfaces of #ClutterClone
 *
 * In particular it sets a proper role for the clone, as just a image,
 * as it is the sanest and simplest approach.
 */

/* Design rationale for CallyClone:
 *
 * In the old times, it was just ClutterCloneTexture. So, from a a11y POV
 * CallyCloneTexture was just another image, like ClutterTexture, and if
 * it was a clone was irrevelant. So on cally-0.8, CallyCloneTexture
 * expose a object with role ATK_ROLE_IMAGE. But now, ClutterClone is more
 * general. You can clone any object, including groups, and made things
 * like have one text entry, and a clone with different properties in the
 * same window, updated both at once.
 *
 * The question is if the idea is have a ClutterClone as a "first-class"
 * citizen inside the stage hierarchy (full clone), or it is just supposed
 * to be a mirror image of the original object.
 *
 * In the case of the a11y POV this would mean that if the text changes on
 * the source, the clone should emit as well the text-changing signals.
 *
 * As ClutterClone smartly just paint the same object with different
 * parameters, this would mean that it should be the cally object the one
 * that should replicate the source clutter hierarchy to do that,
 * something that just sound crazy.
 *
 * Taking into account that:
 *
 * - ClutterClone doesn't re-emit mirrored signals from the source 
 *   I think that likely the answer would be "yes, it is just a
 *   mirrored image, not a real full clone".
 *
 * - You can't interact directly with the clone (ie: focus, and so on).
 *   Its basic usage (right now) is clone textures.
 *
 * Any other solution could be overwhelming.
 *
 * I think that the final solution would be that ClutterClone from the
 * a11y POV should still be managed as a image (with the proper properties,
 * position, size, etc.).
