  * Synchronize packaging with 1.50, summary
    - Update packaging to pull fb and mm from shim-signed package as in
      later releases, dropping the runtime dependency on shim.
    - Add download-signed script from linux-signed package
    - Include reworked Makefile from devel to better assert the integrity of
      the executables.
