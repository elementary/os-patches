Onboard 0.99.0
--------------

Description:

    Onboard is an onscreen keyboard useful for everybody that cannot use a
    hardware keyboard; for example TabletPC users, mobility impaired users,...

    It has been designed with simplicity in mind and can be used right away
    without the need of any configuration, as it can read the keyboard layout
    from the X server.

    Among its features are:
    - Support of custom layouts through the use of xml and svg files.
    - Support of custom themes for the appearance through the use of xml files.
    - Support of macros to automatically type custom defined texts.
    - Support of <modifier>+<mouseclick> combination.
    - Toggling mouse buttons to perform right clicks with the left mouse button.
    - Control of the hover click feature provided by the system.
    - Minimizing the keyboard to the panel, a trayicon, or a floating icon.
    - Docking
    - XEmbedding
    - Support for scanning.


D-Bus Service:

    Once running, Onboard provides a D-Bus service at the bus name
    'org.onboard.Onboard', that allows other processes to control the
    visibiliy of the keyboard window.

    Interface 'org.onboard.Onboard.Keyboard':

    Show(), method
        Show the keyboard window.
        Return value: None

        If auto-show is enabled, the window is locked visible, i.e.
        auto-hiding is suspended until Onboard is hidden either manually
        or by calling the D-Bus method "Hide". This is the same bahavior as if
        Onboard was shown by user action, e.g. by status menu, floating icon
        or by starting a second instance.

        Example:
            dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.onboard.Onboard 
            /org/onboard/Onboard/Keyboard org.onboard.Onboard.Keyboard.Show

    Hide(), method
        Hide the keyboard window.
        Return value: None

        Example:
            dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.onboard.Onboard 
            /org/onboard/Onboard/Keyboard org.onboard.Onboard.Keyboard.Hide

    ToggleVisible(), method
        Show the keyboard window if it was hidden, else hide it.
        Return value: None

        Example:
            dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.onboard.Onboard 
            /org/onboard/Onboard/Keyboard
            org.onboard.Onboard.Keyboard.ToggleVisible

    Visible, Boolean property, read-only
        True if the window is currently visible, False otherwise.
        Signal: org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged

        Example:
        dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.onboard.Onboard 
        /org/onboard/Onboard/Keyboard org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get 
        string:"org.onboard.Onboard.Keyboard" string:"Visible"
